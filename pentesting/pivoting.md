# Pivoting, Tunneling, and Port Forwarding 
Port forwarding is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even SOCKS (non-application layer) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.

## SSH Local Port Forwarding

### Scanning the Pivot Target
```
nmap -sT -p22,3306 $rhost

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
3306/tcp closed mysql
```
The Nmap output shows that the SSH port is open. To access the MySQL service, we can either SSH into the server and access MySQL from inside the Ubuntu server, or we can port forward it to our localhost on port 1234 and access it locally. A benefit of accessing it locally is if we want to execute a remote exploit on the MySQL service, we won't be able to do it without port forwarding. This is due to MySQL being hosted locally on the Ubuntu server on port 3306. So, we will use the below command to forward our local port (1234) over SSH to the Ubuntu server.

### Executing the Local Port Forward
```
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
The -L command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port 1234 to localhost:3306 on the Ubuntu server. By doing this, we should be able to access the MySQL service locally on port 1234. We can use Netstat or Nmap to query our local host on 1234 port to verify whether the MySQL service was forwarded.

### Confirming Port Forward with Netstat
```
netstat -antp | grep 1234

(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:1234          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4034/ssh            
tcp6       0      0 ::1:1234                :::*                    LISTEN      4034/ssh   
```

### Confirming Port Forward with Nmap
```
nmap -v -sV -p1234 localhost

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
1234/tcp open  mysql   MySQL 8.0.28-0ubuntu0.20.04.3
```

Similarly, if we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, you can do so by including the local port:server:port argument to your ssh command. For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on 8080.

### Forwarding Multiple Ports
```
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

### Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH

```
ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
The -D argument requests the SSH server to enable dynamic port forwarding. Once we have this enabled, we will require a tool that can route any tool's packets over the port 9050. We can do this using the tool proxychains, which is capable of redirecting TCP connections through TOR, SOCKS, and HTTP/HTTPS proxy servers and also allows us to chain multiple proxy servers together. Using proxychains, we can hide the IP address of the requesting host as well since the receiving host will only see the IP of the pivot host. Proxychains is often used to force an application's TCP traffic to go through hosted proxies like SOCKS4/SOCKS5, TOR, or HTTP/HTTPS proxies.

To inform proxychains that we must use port 9050, we must modify the proxychains configuration file located at /etc/proxychains.conf. We can add socks4 127.0.0.1 9050 to the last line if it is not already there.

### Checking /etc/proxychains.conf
```
 tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
```
Now when you start Nmap with proxychains using the below command, it will route all the packets of Nmap to the local port 9050, where our SSH client is listening, which will forward all the packets over SSH to the 172.16.5.0/23 network.

### Using Nmap with Proxychains
```
proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200

This part of packing all your Nmap data using proxychains and forwarding it to a remote server is called SOCKS tunneling. One more important note to remember here is that we can only perform a full TCP connect scan over proxychains. The reason for this is that proxychains cannot understand partial packets. If you send partial packets like half connect scans, it will return incorrect results. We also need to make sure we are aware of the fact that host-alive checks may not work against Windows targets because the Windows Defender firewall blocks ICMP requests (traditional pings) by default.

[A full TCP connect scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) without ping on an entire network range will take a long time. So, for this module, we will primarily focus on scanning individual hosts, or smaller ranges of hosts we know are alive, which in this case will be a Windows host at 172.16.5.19. We will perform a remote system scan using the below command.

### Enumerating the Windows Target through Proxychains
```
proxychains nmap -v -Pn -sT 172.16.5.19
```

### Using Metasploit with Proxychains
```
proxychains msfconsole
```
Let's use the rdp_scanner auxiliary module to check if the host on the internal network is listening on 3389.

### Using rdp_scanner Module
```
search rdp_scanner
use 0
set rhosts 172.16.5.19
run
```
Depending on the level of access we have to this host during an assessment, we may try to run an exploit or log in using gathered credentials. For this module, we will log in to the Windows remote host over the SOCKS tunnel. This can be done using xfreerdp. The user in our case is victor, and the password is pass@123

### Using xfreerdp with Proxychains
``` proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```
