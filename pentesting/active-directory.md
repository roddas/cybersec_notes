# Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

## External Recon and Enumeration Principles
Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform external reconnaissance of your target. This can serve many different functions, such as:
 * Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
 * Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
 * Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials

We may also dive as deep as scanning GitHub repositories for credentials left in code pushes, hunting in documents for links to an intranet or remotely accessible sites, and just looking for any information that can key us in on how the enterprise environment is configured.

## What Are We Looking For?

When conducting our external reconnaissance, there are several key items that we should be looking for. This information may not always be publicly accessible, but it would be prudent to see what is out there. If we get stuck during a penetration test, looking back at what could be obtained through passive recon can give us that nudge needed to move forward, such as password breach data that could be used to access a VPN or other externally facing service.

 * **IP Space :** Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.
 * **Domain Information :**  Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)
 * **Schema Format :** Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.
 * **Data Disclosures :** For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain intranet site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.)
 * **Breach Data :** Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.

We have addressed the why and what of external reconnaissance; let's dive into the where and how.

## Where Are We Looking?

* **ASN / IP registrars :** [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), [arin](https://www.arin.net/) for searching the Americas, [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/) for searching in Europe, [BGP Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/)
* **Domain Registrars & DNS :** [Domaintools](https://www.domaintools.com/), [PTRArchive](http://ptrarchive.com/), [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/lookup), manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as 8.8.8.8.
* **Social Media :** Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization.
* **Public-Facing Company Websites :** Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.
* **Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces :** [GitHub](https://github.com/), [AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers](https://grayhatwarfare.com/), [Google searches using "Dorks"](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)
* **Breach Data Sources :** [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.


## Finding Address Spaces

The [BGP-Toolkit](https://he.net/) hosted by Hurricane Electric is a fantastic resource for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN they reside within. Just punch in a domain or IP address, and the toolkit will search for any results it can.


## DNS

DNS is a great way to validate our scope and find out about reachable hosts the customer did not disclose in their scoping document. Sites like [domaintools](https://whois.domaintools.com/), and [viewdns.info](https://viewdns.info/) are great spots to start. 

## Sharepoint Admin Job Listing
Websites hosted by the organization are also great places to dig for information. We can gather contact emails, phone numbers, organizational charts, published documents, etc. These sites, specifically the embedded documents, can often have links to internal infrastructure or intranet sites that you would not otherwise know about. Checking any publicly accessible information for those types of details can be quick wins when trying to formulate a picture of the domain structure. With the growing use of sites such as GitHub, AWS cloud storage, and other web-hosted platforms, data can also be leaked unintentionally. 

Tools like [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) and sites like [Greyhat Warfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/) are fantastic resources for finding these breadcrumbs.

### Username Harvesting

We can use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last, etc.) that can be added to our list of potential password spraying targets.

### Credential Hunting

[Dehashed](http://dehashed.com/) is an excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.
