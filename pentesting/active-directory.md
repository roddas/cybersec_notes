# Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

## External Recon and Enumeration Principles
Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform external reconnaissance of your target. This can serve many different functions, such as:
 * Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
 * Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
 * Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials

We may also dive as deep as scanning GitHub repositories for credentials left in code pushes, hunting in documents for links to an intranet or remotely accessible sites, and just looking for any information that can key us in on how the enterprise environment is configured.

## What Are We Looking For?

When conducting our external reconnaissance, there are several key items that we should be looking for. This information may not always be publicly accessible, but it would be prudent to see what is out there. If we get stuck during a penetration test, looking back at what could be obtained through passive recon can give us that nudge needed to move forward, such as password breach data that could be used to access a VPN or other externally facing service.

 * **IP Space :** Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.
 * **Domain Information :**  Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)
 * **Schema Format :** Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.
 * **Data Disclosures :** For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain intranet site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.)
 * **Breach Data :** Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.

We have addressed the why and what of external reconnaissance; let's dive into the where and how.

## Where Are We Looking?

* **ASN / IP registrars :** [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), [arin](https://www.arin.net/) for searching the Americas, [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/) for searching in Europe, [BGP Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/)
* **Domain Registrars & DNS :** [Domaintools](https://www.domaintools.com/), [PTRArchive](http://ptrarchive.com/), [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/lookup), manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as 8.8.8.8.
* **Social Media :** Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization.
* **Public-Facing Company Websites :** Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.
* **Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces :** [GitHub](https://github.com/), [AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers](https://grayhatwarfare.com/), [Google searches using "Dorks"](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)
* **Breach Data Sources :** [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.


## Finding Address Spaces

The [BGP-Toolkit](https://he.net/) hosted by Hurricane Electric is a fantastic resource for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN they reside within. Just punch in a domain or IP address, and the toolkit will search for any results it can.


## DNS

DNS is a great way to validate our scope and find out about reachable hosts the customer did not disclose in their scoping document. Sites like [domaintools](https://whois.domaintools.com/), and [viewdns.info](https://viewdns.info/) are great spots to start. 

## Sharepoint Admin Job Listing
Websites hosted by the organization are also great places to dig for information. We can gather contact emails, phone numbers, organizational charts, published documents, etc. These sites, specifically the embedded documents, can often have links to internal infrastructure or intranet sites that you would not otherwise know about. Checking any publicly accessible information for those types of details can be quick wins when trying to formulate a picture of the domain structure. With the growing use of sites such as GitHub, AWS cloud storage, and other web-hosted platforms, data can also be leaked unintentionally. 

Tools like [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) and sites like [Greyhat Warfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/) are fantastic resources for finding these breadcrumbs.

## Hunting For Files
```
filetype:pdf inurl:inlanefreight.com
```

## Hunting E-mail Addresses
```
intext:"@inlanefreight.com" inurl:inlanefreight.com
```

### Username Harvesting

We can use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last, etc.) that can be added to our list of potential password spraying targets.

### Credential Hunting

[Dehashed](http://dehashed.com/) is an excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.

```

## Initial Enumeration of the Domain

We are at the very beginning of our AD-focused penetration test against Inlanefreight. We have done some basic information gathering and gotten a picture of what to expect from the customer via the scoping documents.

### Tasks
Our tasks to accomplish for this section are:
 * Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
 * This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
 * Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!

### Key Data Points

 * **AD Users :** We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying.
 * **AD Joined Computers :** Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, database servers, etc.
 * **Key Services :**  	Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS
 * **Vulnerable Hosts and Services :** Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold)

## TTPs

Enumerating an AD environment can be overwhelming if just approached without a plan. There is an abundance of data stored in AD, and it can take a long time to sift if not looked at in progressive stages, and we will likely miss things. We need to set a game plan for ourselves and tackle it piece by piece. Everyone works in slightly different ways, so as we gain more experience, we'll start to develop our own repeatable methodology that works best for us. Regardless of how we proceed, we typically start in the same place and look for the same data points. We will experiment with many tools in this section and subsequent ones. It is important to reproduce every example and even try to recreate examples with different tools to see how they work differently, learn their syntax, and find what approach works best for us.

We will start with passive identification of any hosts in the network, followed by active validation of the results to find out more about each host (what services are running, names, potential vulnerabilities, etc.). Once we know what hosts exist, we can proceed with probing those hosts, looking for any interesting data we can glean from them. After we have accomplished these tasks, we should stop and regroup and look at what info we have. At this time, we'll hopefully have a set of credentials or a user account to target for a foothold onto a domain-joined host or have the ability to begin credentialed enumeration from our Linux attack host.

### Identifying Hosts

First, let's take some time to listen to the network and see what's going on. We can use *Wireshark* and *TCPDump* to "put our ear to the wire" and see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. This is particularly helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some ARP requests and replies, MDNS, and other basic layer two packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain) some of which we can see below. This is a great start that gives us a few bits of information about the customer's network setup.

### Start Wireshark on ea-attack01

```
sudo -E wireshark
# Write arp to see the ARP flow
 sudo tcpdump -i <interface> 
```
There is no one right way to listen and capture network traffic. There are plenty of tools that can process network data. Wireshark and tcpdump are just a few of the easiest to use and most widely known. Depending on the host you are on, you may already have a network monitoring tool built-in, such as *pktmon.exe*, which was added to all editions of Windows 10.

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows) is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS requests and responses. It has many more functions, but for now, all we are utilizing is the tool in its Analyze mode. This will passively listen to the network and not send any poisoned packets. We'll cover this tool more in-depth in later sections.

```
sudo responder -I <interface> -A 
```

As we start Responder with passive analysis mode enabled, we will see requests flow in our session. Notice below that we found a few unique hosts not previously mentioned in our Wireshark captures. It's worth noting these down as we are starting to build a nice target list of IPs and DNS hostnames.

Fping provides us with a similar capability as the standard ping application in that it utilizes ICMP requests and replies to reach out and interact with a host. Where fping shines is in its ability to issue ICMP packets against a list of multiple hosts at once and its scriptability. Also, it works in a round-robin fashion, querying hosts in a cyclical manner instead of waiting for multiple requests to a single host to return before moving on. These checks will help us determine if anything else is active on the internal network. ICMP is not a one-stop-shop, but it is an easy way to get an initial idea of what exists. Other open ports and active protocols may point to new hosts for later targeting. Let's see it in action.


### FPing Active Checks

Here we'll start fping with a few flags: a to show targets that are alive, s to print stats at the end of the scan, g to generate a target list from the CIDR network, and q to not show per-target results.

```
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
```

The command above validates which hosts are active in the /23 network and does it quietly instead of spamming the terminal with results for each IP in the target list. We can combine the successful results and the information we gleaned from our passive checks into a list for a more detailed scan with Nmap. From the fping command, we can see 9 "live hosts," including our attack host.

### Nmap Scanning

Now that we have a list of active hosts within our network, we can enumerate those hosts further. We are looking to determine what services each host is running, identify critical hosts such as Domain Controllers and web servers, and identify potentially vulnerable hosts to probe later. With our focus on AD, after doing a broad sweep, it would be wise of us to focus on standard protocols typically seen accompanying AD services, such as DNS, SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos name a few. Below is a quick example of a simple Nmap scan.

```
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum

```
We can see from the output above that we have a potential host running an outdated operating system ( Windows 7, 8, or Server 2008 based on the output). This is of interest to us since it means there are legacy operating systems running in this AD environment. It also means there is potential for older exploits like EternalBlue, MS08-067, and others to work and provide us with a SYSTEM level shell. As weird as it sounds to have hosts running legacy software or end-of-life operating systems, it is still common in large enterprise environments. You will often have some process or equipment such as a production line or the HVAC built on the older OS and has been in place for a long time. Taking equipment like that offline is costly and can hurt an organization, so legacy hosts are often left in place. They will likely try to build a hard outer shell of Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and other monitoring and protection solutions around those systems. If you can find your way into one, it is a big deal and can be a quick and easy foothold. Before exploiting legacy systems, however, we should alert our client and get their approval in writing in case an attack results in system instability or brings a service or the host down. They may prefer that we just observe, report, and move on without actively exploiting the system.

The results of these scans will clue us into where we will start looking for potential domain enumeration avenues, not just host scanning. We need to find our way to a domain user account. Looking at our results, we found several servers that host domain services ( DC01, MX01, WS01, etc.). Now that we know what exists and what services are running, we can poll those servers and attempt to enumerate users. Be sure to use the -oA flag as a best practice when performing Nmap scans. This will ensure that we have our scan results in several formats for logging purposes and formats that can be manipulated and fed into other tools.

We need to be aware of what scans we run and how they work. Some of the Nmap scripted scans run active vulnerability checks against a host that could cause system instability or take it offline, causing issues for the customer or worse. For example, running a large discovery scan against a network with devices such as sensors or logic controllers could potentially overload them and disrupt the customer's industrial equipment causing a loss of product or capability. Take the time to understand the scans you use before running them in a customer's environment.

We will most likely return to these results later for further enumeration, so don't forget about them. We need to find our way to a domain user account or SYSTEM level access on a domain-joined host so we can gain a foothold and start the real fun. Let's dive into finding a user account.

## Identifying Users

[Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. We will use Kerbrute in conjunction with the *jsmith.txt* or *jsmith2.txt* user lists from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames). This repository contains many different user lists that can be extremely useful when attempting to enumerate users when starting from an unauthenticated perspective. We can point Kerbrute at the DC we found earlier and feed it a wordlist. The tool is quick, and we will be provided with results letting us know if the accounts found are valid or not, which is a great starting point for launching attacks such as password spraying, which we will cover in-depth later in this module.

### Cloning Kerbrute GitHub Repo

```
sudo git clone https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute.git
sudo make all
ls dist/
```

### Testing the kerbrute_linux_amd64 Binary
```
./kerbrute_linux_amd64
sudo mv kerbrute_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kerbrute
```

### Enumerating Users with Kerbrute
```
kerbrute userenum -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users
```

### Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities

The local system account NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is a built-in account in Windows operating systems. It has the highest level of access in the OS and is used to run most Windows services. It is also very common for third-party services to run in the context of this account by default. A SYSTEM account on a domain-joined host will be able to enumerate Active Directory by impersonating the computer account, which is essentially just another kind of user account. Having SYSTEM-level access within a domain environment is nearly equivalent to having a domain user account.

There are several ways to gain SYSTEM-level access on a host, including but not limited to:
 * Remote Windows exploits such as MS08-067, EternalBlue, or BlueKeep.
 * Abusing a service running in the context of the SYSTEM account, or abusing the service account SeImpersonate privileges using [Juicy Potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato). This type of attack is possible on older Windows OS' but not always possible with Windows Server 2019.
 * Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems such as the Windows 10 Task Scheduler 0-day.
 * Gaining admin access on a domain-joined host with a local account and using Psexec to launch a SYSTEM cmd window
By gaining SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host, you will be able to perform actions such as, but not limited to:
 * Enumerate the domain using built-in tools or offensive tools such as BloodHound and PowerView.
 * Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks within the same domain.
 * Run tools such as Inveigh to gather Net-NTLMv2 hashes or perform SMB relay attacks.
 * Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
 * Carry out ACL attacks.

 # LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Linux

This section and the next will cover a common way to gather credentials and gain an initial foothold during an assessment: a Man-in-the-Middle attack on Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) broadcasts. Depending on the network, this attack may provide low-privileged or administrative level password hashes that can be cracked offline or even cleartext credentials. Though not covered in this module, these hashes can also sometimes be used to perform an SMB Relay attack to authenticate to a host or multiple hosts in the domain with administrative privileges without having to crack the password hash offline. Let's dive in!

## LLMNR & NBT-NS Primer

[Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4795) and [NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc940063(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails. If a machine attempts to resolve a host but DNS resolution fails, typically, the machine will try to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. It uses port 5355 over UDP natively. If LLMNR fails, the NBT-NS will be used. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. NBT-NS utilizes port 137 over UDP.

The kicker here is that when LLMNR/NBT-NS are used for name resolution, ANY host on the network can reply. This is where we come in with Responder to poison these requests. With network access, we can spoof an authoritative name resolution source ( in this case, a host that's supposed to belong in the network segment ) in the broadcast domain by responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic as if they have an answer for the requesting host. This poisoning effort is done to get the victims to communicate with our system by pretending that our rogue system knows the location of the requested host. If the requested host requires name resolution or authentication actions, we can capture the NetNTLM hash and subject it to an offline brute force attack in an attempt to retrieve the cleartext password. The captured authentication request can also be relayed to access another host or used against a different protocol (such as LDAP) on the same host. LLMNR/NBNS spoofing combined with a lack of SMB signing can often lead to administrative access on hosts within a domain. SMB Relay attacks will be covered in a later module about Lateral Movement.

## Quick Example - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning

Let's walk through a quick example of the attack flow at a very high level:
 1. A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
 2. The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
 3. The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
 4. The attacker (us with Responder running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
 5. The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.
 6. This hash can then be cracked offline or used in an SMB Relay attack if the right conditions exist.

## TTPs

We are performing these actions to collect authentication information sent over the network in the form of NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 password hashes. As discussed in the Introduction to Active Directory module, NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash. We will then take the hash and attempt to crack them offline using tools such as Hashcat or John with the goal of obtaining the account's cleartext password to be used to gain an initial foothold or expand our access within the domain if we capture a password hash for an account with more privileges than an account that we currently possess.

Several tools can be used to attempt LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning:
 1. **Responder :** [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions.
 2. **Inveigh :** [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) is a cross-platform MITM platform that can be used for spoofing and poisoning attacks.
 3. **Metasploit :** [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks.

Responder and Inveigh can be used to attack the following protocols: LLMNR, DNS, MDNS, NBNS, DHCP, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, LDAP, WebDAV, Proxy Auth. 
Responder also has support for: MSSQL, DCE-RPC, FTP, POP3, IMAP, and SMTP auth.

### Starting Responder with Default Settings
```
sudo responder -I ens224 
```

### Capturing with Responder
Typically we should start Responder and let it run for a while in a tmux window while we perform other enumeration tasks to maximize the number of hashes that we can obtain. Once we are ready, we can pass these hashes to Hashcat using hash mode 5600 for NTLMv2 hashes that we typically obtain with Responder. We may at times obtain NTLMv1 hashes and other types of hashes and can consult the Hashcat example hashes page to identify them and find the proper hash mode.

# LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Windows
This section will explore the tool Inveigh and attempt to capture another set of credentials.

## Inveigh - Overview

 [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, including LLMNR, DNS, mDNS, NBNS, DHCPv6, ICMPv6, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, LDAP, WebDAV, and Proxy Auth. 
We can get started with the PowerShell version as follows and then list all possible parameters. There is a wiki that lists all parameters and usage instructions.

```
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\Inveigh.ps1
PS C:\htb> (Get-Command Invoke-Inveigh).Parameters
```

Let's start Inveigh with LLMNR and NBNS spoofing, and output to the console and write to a file. We will leave the rest of the defaults, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh#parameter-help).
```
PS C:\htb> Invoke-Inveigh Y -NBNS Y -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y
```

## C# Inveigh (InveighZero)

The PowerShell version of Inveigh is the original version and is no longer updated. The tool author maintains the C# version, which combines the original PoC C# code and a C# port of most of the code from the PowerShell version. Before we can use the C# version of the tool, we have to compile the executable. 

```
PS C:\htb> .\Inveigh.exe
```

### Remediation

Mitre ATT&CK lists this technique as [ID: T1557.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), *Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay*.

There are a few ways to mitigate this attack. To ensure that these spoofing attacks are not possible, we can disable LLMNR and NBT-NS. As a word of caution, it is always worth slowly testing out a significant change like this to your environment carefully before rolling it out fully. As penetration testers, we can recommend these remediation steps, but should clearly communicate to our clients that they should test these changes heavily to ensure that disabling both protocols does not break anything in the network.

We can disable LLMNR in Group Policy by going to Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Network --> DNS Client and enabling "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution."

NBT-NS cannot be disabled via Group Policy but must be disabled locally on each host. We can do this by opening Network and Sharing Center under Control Panel, clicking on Change adapter settings, right-clicking on the adapter to view its properties, selecting Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and clicking the Properties button, then clicking on Advanced and selecting the WINS tab and finally selecting Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP.

Advanced TCP/IP Settings window showing WINS addresses, LMHOSTS lookup enabled, and NetBIOS settings options.

While it is not possible to disable NBT-NS directly via GPO, we can create a PowerShell script under Computer Configuration --> Windows Settings --> Script (Startup/Shutdown) --> Startup with something like the following:
```

$regkey = "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces"
Get-ChildItem $regkey |foreach { Set-ItemProperty -Path "$regkey\$($_.pschildname)" -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2 -Verbose}

```
In the Local Group Policy Editor, we will need to double click on Startup, choose the PowerShell Scripts tab, and select "For this GPO, run scripts in the following order" to Run Windows PowerShell scripts first, and then click on Add and choose the script. For these changes to occur, we would have to either reboot the target system or restart the network adapter.

To push this out to all hosts in a domain, we could create a GPO using Group Policy Management on the Domain Controller and host the script on the SYSVOL share in the scripts folder and then call it via its UNC path such as:

\\inlanefreight.local\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

Once the GPO is applied to specific OUs and those hosts are restarted, the script will run at the next reboot and disable NBT-NS, provided that the script still exists on the SYSVOL share and is accessible by the host over the network.


Other mitigations include filtering network traffic to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traffic and enabling SMB Signing to prevent NTLM relay attacks. Network intrusion detection and prevention systems can also be used to mitigate this activity, while network segmentation can be used to isolate hosts that require LLMNR or NetBIOS enabled to operate correctly.

### Detection

It is not always possible to disable LLMNR and NetBIOS, and therefore we need ways to detect this type of attack behavior. One way is to use the attack against the attackers by injecting LLMNR and NBT-NS requests for non-existent hosts across different subnets and alerting if any of the responses receive answers which would be indicative of an attacker spoofing name resolution responses. [This blog post](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/) explains this method more in-depth.

Furthermore, hosts can be monitored for traffic on ports UDP 5355 and 137, and event IDs 4697 and 7045 can be monitored for. Finally, we can monitor the registry key *HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient* for changes to the *EnableMulticast* DWORD value. A value of 0 would mean that LLMNR is disabled.


# Password Spraying Overview

Password spraying can result in gaining access to systems and potentially gaining a foothold on a target network. The attack involves attempting to log into an exposed service using one common password and a longer list of usernames or email addresses. The usernames and emails may have been gathered during the OSINT phase of the penetration test or our initial enumeration attempts. Remember that a penetration test is not static, but we are constantly iterating through several techniques and repeating processes as we uncover new data. Often we will be working in a team or executing multiple TTPs at once to utilize our time effectively.

## Story Time

Password spraying can be a very effective way to gain a foothold internally. There are many times that this technique has helped me land a foothold during my assessments.

### Scenario 1

In this first example, I performed all my standard checks and could not find anything useful like an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind that could allow me to retrieve a list of valid users. So I decided to use the Kerbrute tool to build a target username list by enumerating valid domain users (a technique we will cover later in this section). To create this list, I took the jsmith.txt username list from the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo and combined this with results that I got from scraping LinkedIn. With this combined list in hand, I enumerated valid users with Kerbrute and then used the same tool to password spray with the common password Welcome1. I got two hits with this password for very low privileged users, but this gave me enough access within the domain to run BloodHound and eventually identify attack paths that led to domain compromise.
